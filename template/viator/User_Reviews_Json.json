Our bus was split into two groups which was nice as we could hear our tour guide well. Our time in Rothenburg was so much fun. It was really just a matter of “how much can I cram into 3 hours?!” We walked through the Christmas markets and got lunch on the go, did a tour at St Jakobs Lutheran Church, and took our time shopping on on the walk back to the bus. We even stopped to get some schneeballen which were recommended by our tour guide (and now I recommend them to you!!)",

Rothenberg is stunning we loved the medieval architecture, beautifully decorated for Chrsitmas, pleased we went. The castle on route and castle guide were also really interesting and enthusiastic. It's a shame this trip can't be done on the train independently, it was going to be too long with a lot of changes. Our guide Babara I would say came across rather flat, which on a long trip is a shame. She also recommended at resturant with not great reviews, she seemed keen we all eat there telling us there were limited options, I felt there maybe a commision system there. I would also make sure you get on the right bus and be very clear, before departure Lots of trip buses leave from the same spot. One couple ended up on the wrong trip as tickets weren't checked properly.  4 stars for the location. The actual tour  company would be a low 3.",

Given the distances involved it was inevitably a long day, nearly eleven hours but, that again, was pre-warned. The half-way stop at Harburg Castle with the opportunity for a guided tour (addition 10 Euros pp) was well worth it. A real medieval castle with a long history of being the target of many sieges. Then onward to Rothenburg when, sadly, things began to deteriorate. Not, I hasten to add, any fault of Viator or the tour operator. A Saturday before Christmas was probably the wrong time to visit. To say the town was rammed would be an understatement. Rothenburg might be the most attractive town in Germany but not when one is jostled from crowded coach park to market square and back!",

All in all, it was a good trip and wonderful to see the countryside outside of the city. The palace is pretty cool, but small. Neuschwanstein is impressive, but it's hard not to feel like it's an extremely elaborate set at an amusement park. The tour of the castle is about the same length as the palace since only about 30% of the castle is finished. That was somewhat disappointing, given the $33 price tag for admission to both buildings. \n\nThe Viator tour guide didn't really do much. He was nice and provided a few interesting facts at a few parts during the long driving sections, but he pretty much left us to our own devices once we were parked and our tickets were dispersed at the castle.

          "text": "Absolutely amazing ! We were hesitant to book the larger group tour after reading some reviews but we are so glad that we did. It saved a lot of money as the €33 pp is the entry for both Linderhof palace and Neuschwanstein castle. Plenty of stops to look around and ample time at each stop - did not feel rushed at all and the day flowed very smoothly. The tour lady was brilliant! She was very informative and told us enough information without bombarding us. Unfortunately we did not catch her name but her dinosaur is called Benji (: \n\nTip: pack drinks and snacks for the day as stopping at restaurants can take up a large portion of your time at the stops",

The drive through the desert was exhilarating! We went over sand dunes and had a blast. Our drivers, Jawid and Husain were phenomenal. We also had black tea after our amazing camel roses. We went to the Inland Sea, and saw the tip of Saudi Arabia. We only had 17 hours in Doha, and by doing this excursion we got to experience Doha in a whole new light. We also added the evening tour.",

Upon pick up at the hotel - he never exited the vehicle to introduce himself or greet us. We scrambled in the backseat, he handed us a piece of paper \"you need to sign this\" ... then drove. The first time we even saw his face was when we stopped to deflate the tires. - His driving skills and knowledge of the desert were good - as for customer service or interaction... hmmm... ",

Then onto a dune bashing drive with more septactular scenery (compared to Dubai) with the Inland Sea views, with a stop overlooking the inland sea. I opted out of the sandboarding and Mujahid said would give me more time to relax at inland sea beach...which was great! Great experience and photos! DO IT. ",

          "text": "I booked a city and desert tour combo and really was glad I booked both! I was travelling solo and booked the tour for myself only and was abit nervous going on the private trip by myself (as it was my first time travelling solo like this). But my tour guide, Ismail, was the most considerate and respectful guide and made me comfortable. \nWe did the city tour in the early morning, which was  all very interesting because Ismail would give you extra information about Qatar beyond what you see to understand the culture and living in Qatar. I did feel the city tour was worth it if you enjoy the more laid back touring and observing scenery type of vibe. Apparently the city tour is better later in the afternoon/evening when it is busier to really see the life of Qataris and to experience it. But nevertheless, it was worth the experience. \nI was beyond glad that the combo tour included the desert tour which was probably the best part of the tour! It is exhilarating! You will experience camel ride (which will cost 20 QR for a short experience which is mostly what you need for photos, you can pay more for longer rides), beautiful desert scenery, dune bashing (which Ismail was extremely experienced at with his driving skills), sand boarding and seeing the borders/mountains of Saudi Arabia from Qatar which you can end off with a beautiful swim (and the water feels amazing). \nI would recommend the combo tour to anyone! But if you are only seeking some adrenaline rush, then the desert tour is it! If you are travelling alone like me, you will still be looked after by your tour guide as he will make sure you are enjoying yourself and bring the car closer to you if your feet are burning from the desert sand. Thank you Ismail for the wonderful experience and being such a great tour guide. ",

Since the moment he picked us up at the hotel until he kindly dropped us off at the airport he made sure that we were doing what we wanted, we had all the information about Doha/Qatar as he could could provide and made sure we had FUN!!! He is polite, educated and funny, and one hell of a great desert driver!  The sand blasting is just so much fun people should enjoy it and let him do it, even though it may seem scary.  He knows what he is doing and it’s a one in a life time experience!! He is also a great photographer and too gorgeous photos of me and my friend!  \nDon’t hesitate to pay for any tour because they are worth it. And make sure to ask for Ismael. He will do his best to make your experience unforgettable! I can’t wait to go back to Doha/Qatar and explore other parts of the country! ",

          "text": "I decided to avail of a transit visit to Doha on my way back to the United States. This tour caught my attention as it covered what otherwise would have been two separate tours. I only had one full day so this was just perfect for me. My tour guide was Ismael who was very nice, kind and capable. He brought me to the different must-see spots in Doha, that included the Katara Cultural Village, the Pearl Island, the Souq Waqif and the National Museum of Qatar. He provided important information about these places. After the city tour we drove south to visit the sand dunes where I rode a camel and experienced dune bashing for the first time. Dune bashing was thrilling and exciting and I am glad I did it with Ismael who was a talented and safe driver , with lots of experience driving on the dunes. I hope to visit Doha again when the weather is milder, and have more time to explore the city. ",

He was very helpful and obliging to take photos for us and had a good knowledge of the city sites. I think he took it easy on us during the dune bashing, 2 screaming ladies laughing and carrying on, we had so much fun! Salman showed us as much as possible of what Doha had to offer and the tour was everything we hoped it would be. Salman arrived just before our agreed pick up, the vehicle was very clean, we had as much cold water as we wanted and also stopped for tea. Highly recommend Salman and this particular tour.",

Benefit of visiting between noon and 4pm was the lack of crowds but wish we would have seen the open market vendors and locals enjoying the cooler evenings.  We toured the beautiful museum and learned about the history of Qatar (16 and under free entry). Overall a great and memorable experience during a long layover on our way home.",

Maya Beach was crowded and hectic but well worth a visit if you like the film The Beach - lunch was good at the 4 star resort. The departure port was luxury compared to others with free coffee and sea sickness tablets. ",

From the historical context that was shared about the different islands to the fun and lighthearted vibes that were set from the very beginning. The speedboat route is definitely the way to go because you get. More personalized and intimate tour, instead of being hoarded up on a big ship with 60 other people where you aren’t able to ask questions or build rapport with the tour guide.",

We were picked up from our cruise ship port, and driven to the Royal Marina where we boarded a luxurious cabin cruiser for our voyage to the Phi Phi Islands. We were a relatively small group of 20.  Our tour guide Took Took (not sure of spelling) and his team were fantastic!  Funny, polite and attentive.  They gave us bottomless water, coke, and sprite, as well as fresh fruit several times. They took us to several famous spots (Maya and Monkey beaches) then snorkeling.  We ate a delicious lunch at the Holiday Inn beachside resort (included), then finished up the day with swimming and sunbathing at Bamboo Beach.  A really lovely day!  The only negative was the somewhat bumpy boat ride to the Phi Phi arpeggio.  If you want a smoother ride, sit in the back of the boat.  ",

Our guide/tour staff were excellent and I was thoroughly impressed. It is a full day trip so come energized and ready to explore! One note of caution - if you get easily seasick, be aware there is a full hour speed boat trip each way from the harbor to the islands. Not an issue at all for my wife and I but if you are uncomfortable on choppy water or easily seasick, be prepared and aware there will be two, one hour speed boat trips. This wasn’t an issue or drawback for us at all and the boat ride is very pretty - just want others to have that knowledge! ",

We had paid for the photographer package, so we had assistance when snorkelling for the first time, as we are not strong swimmers this was incredibly useful for us, the photographer (sorry can’t remember his name but do have a photo!) assisted us and advised us of the best areas to see the underwater views, he was such fun.  We had a lovely lunch at one of the islands, drinks, snacks and fresh fruit were also available onboard.\nThe only stop on the tour we didn’t enjoy quite as much was the Ko Phi Phi Le island where The Beach movie was filmed, this was purely due to it being so crowded with tourists, it was beautiful just very busy!\nIf you are in Thailand I would whole heartedly recommend this trip!",

They picked us up from our hotel right at the scheduled time and took us to the marina. Once the tour was assembled you leave from there to the first island where you have breakfast during the sunrise. Next went to Maya Bay where The Beach was filmed, snorkeling , Monkey Island, snorkeling at a different location, Don Phi Phi (lunch), and then Bambooo island (nicest beach and most picturesque). All amazing experiences and the tour guide P was super nice and took many pictures for us. They have a ton of water and soft drinks in board the boat that they are constantly handing you. The lunch at Don Phi Phi was a Thai buffet that was really good. Highly recommended, I felt I got my money’s worth. The 5am tour was good because the crowds were already starting to form, I imagine the later times would be overrun with other tours.",

          "text": "The tranquility of this houseboat tour was amazing! Our guide Shaji, got us on our way with pickup at the hotel and a short trip to the houseboat. On board was our guide, the pilot, 1 crew and chef. The boat itself was large with a lower deck and comfortable seating and dining table. There was also an upper deck which they put cushions down for laid back lounging. The scenery views were awesome and Shaji was great about explaining the history of the houseboats, the rice paddies and how the locals live. A good tour guide is critical to the experience of a tour and he was exceptional. Chef prepared an amazing meal that was classic Indian. This area is simply gorgeous with the palm trees, numerous houseboats and canals, a must if you are in the area! Highly recommended!",

Peter was responsible for the entire tour airport to airport, including local siteseeing in Fort Kochi, backwater boat ride and lunch near Allepey and touring Thekkady and finally dropping us off in Trivandrum. Peter was great at sharing tour options, booking us the best seats for Kathakali and Kalari shows, and sending us well-informed guides. All gyudes spoke good English. Our driver, Martin Pramod, was great. He stayed with us throughout our week in Kerala and gave us lots of good suggestions for local restaurants and shopping. Would really recommend Peter and Carnival tour!",

          "text": "Kochi Backwater Day Cruise , this is a must if UR visiting with a stay in Kochi . The boat jetty is just past the Lakeshore Hospital at the end of the road . U have to book it at least 2 days ahead . Mr Panicker is a very pleasant gentleman very keen to please U. Raji the boat driver / guide was also happy to please U. The  motor boat is a 8 seater with shaded areas , They provide U with  life jackets and provide a printed  instruction card as to how to wear it and what to do in case of an emergency . There is a fire extinguisher on board as well . The chairs have cushions and very comfortable . Because of slow tourist visits due to Covid their business has been scaled down . They use to provide a onboard kitchen for lunch this was also summer time so that was not offered , bottled water is available and there is a clean toilet at the jetty but not on board . The tour price person or group is quite reasonable, for the 3 hour tour . They stop on different islands in the back waters , at fisherman’s homes and , fishery farms . If U want to buy fresh fish , make sure U bring plastic bags . Wear a hat and make sure U have Sun screen . There is a nice breeze when the boat is moving , but being April it can be hot . We bought some fresh River fish and clams from the fisherman . Different migratory birds in plenty are seen in December to February. We saw some Siberian Cranes who come to feed on the clams . Best to bring glasses for bird watching . The mangroves are beautiful to see . Fisherman ‘s homes are simple & practical . They have to use a boat to come to the mainland . They have electricity and running clean tap water . The fisherman R very friendly . Bring UR camera . Yes I would definitely do this again on my next visit to Kochi , hopefully in winter for bird watching .",

Our driver, Mejo was stuck in traffic, so we took a tuk tuk to meet the driver in order to stay on schedule.  At the dock, we completed the paperwork then took a water taxi to the beautiful houseboat.  I was traveling solo but felt very comfortable all throughout the day, chatting with Sando. On board the 3 crew introduced themselves and made me feel at home.  The cruise is beautiful through the backwaters, passing homes where life on the water is seen first hand - fishing, swimming, washing clothes, bathing and fields of rice during harvest season.  Saw many species of birds.  Some of the travel is on the open water out in the bay also.  Lunch was delicious and so much food.  There were many choices, all very delicious.  The cook even offered to show us how to make one of the tomato dishes that was great and something even I could make at home.  Yes, I even got a private cooking lesson in the galley.  So enjoyable, the day went by so very quickly.\nYes, it's expensive for one person, and with the added expense for an English speaking guide, but it's a once in a lifetime experience that should not be passed up.  I loved every minute of it.  That evening when I was dropped off at my hotel I felt that the day could have not been more perfect.",

As per the Booking information received from tripadvisor,we arranged the boat and send a driver to pick you from the Hotel ,you were staying .  \n\nWhen the driver reported at Hotel for pick up ,we were informed that you are not at the hotel and went outside . So we contacted you on your phone and you had informed us that you havent received any confirmation for the tour you had booked ,so that you had made another arrangements .So we marked reservation as a No SHOW \n\nWe dont know why ,why you havent received a confirmation from Tripadvisor ,We are helpless for any techincal issues happening on any Online Booking platforms . \n\nYou should have immediately contacted the bank or tripadvisor customer care,when you had found that you card has been charged and confirmation was not received ,i believe which was not done .\n\nWe are not a company who cheats customer ,you can see that there was not a single negative for this tour ,apart from your review .\n\nI know its frustrating ,when situation happens like this during your holdiays .We once again sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused\n\nRegards\n\nTeam Carnival\n\n",

Vi hade hört en mängd om dessa husbåtar, trodde att de var få, svåra att få tag i och en massa mer. Man kunde få egen båt (som den på bilden ungefär) med egen kock, driva runt bland sjöar, floder och det som heter backwaters. Sagt och gjort. Sona, se ovan, fixade detta, med bästa kocken Vi hade diskret förklarat att min son är kock och intresserad av all mat. I två dygn åkte vi runt på vår båt ( fanns ett par tusen till) som ett flytande hotell. Inte gratis, men inte mer än en vanlig kväll kan kosta på krogen. Då fick vi, så klart, suverän mat, hotelllstandard på allt, natur, människor, se allt det fågelliv som verkar osannolikt. Risfält så långt ögat når. Detta är för ett par dagar, inte bara för en liten dagsresa, om man vill uppleva något.",

He gave thoughtful historical context about the architecture, city layout and historical figures significant to the history of India and Jodhpur specifically. There is no question that the man knows his city well. We were able to venture to incredible vantage points for memorable views of the city. The tour definitely takes you through roads less traveled by and Yogesh did a great job safely navigating us through the narrow alleys and chaos that could prove challenging to unaided tourists. Lastly we were able to sample some delicious chai and samosas through local vendors. Yogesh is proficient in several languages and has has worked with many foreign tourists. I would highly recommend him for the average tourist, but also to any Indians born abroad that would like to get a better sense of their history. I could not recommend this tour without the highest enthusiasm.",

Deepak did ask us if we wanted to go and was honest about the commission he earns if we buy something so this isn’t a criticism of him or his tour, just mentioning it in case you want to avoid awkwardly needing to look around a shop of things you’re not going to buy.",

          "text": "I just want to take the time to write this review and say how incredible not only the city tour was, but how kind and genuine Deepak is. \nWe booked a city tour for 9am, however, the morning of the tour my wife wasn't feeling too good. So I went to reception and spoke to Deepak about delaying for an hour or so, to see if there were any improvements. Deepak was more than happy to delay the tour to wait for my wife, even as far as me coming down to reception again at 11am to say my wife wasn't any better and Deepak saying, that's totally fine, 'we are not doing the tour without her, I want to show both of you my city'. So he suggested waiting until 4pm, whilst also giving suggestions on things that would help my wife feel better. Come 4pm, my wife was feeling a lot better and we went on the city tour.  We both had a great experience, loved visiting the Fort, wandering the streets of the 'blue city' and then ended in a stunning 450 year old building enjoying a beer on a roof top terrace, with an outstanding view of the hilltop fort. It was a great afternoon. And thanks to Deepaks patience and kindness, we both got to enjoy the tour and the city. \nWould highly recommend. ",

He was able to manage both French (for one of our party) and English as he showed us the beautiful places and told their story. He never seemed to want to hurry us along and responded willingly to our requests to see things not on his usual route. When my daughter had a coat made, Deepak took the trouble to fetch the finished item and bring it to the hotel. At the end of the day he recommended a cooking lesson in a private house which was utterly wonderful. Thank you Deepak!",

          "text": "Soham was our Guide and showed us a unique city at a unique time. Experiencing the start of a normal day in Kolkata and utilizing the many various types of public transportation was a fun and exciting way to see the different parts. Soham was very knowledgeable and I surely learnt a lot from his explanations and answers to our questions. We also were able to have the tasting senses energized with delicious Karak and a traditional local breakfast that even the Locals were lining up and waiting for a table for. This tour has been well thought out to cover and tick so many boxes. It’s 100% definitely worth getting up at 6am and the photos shared after the tour is also a very nice touch. Thoroughly enjoyed the tour and would be very honored to recommend Soham as a fabulous Ambassador and Guide of his City and Country to all of my friends and family. I will stay in touch with Soham as I’m sure I will visit this special City again in the near future. ",

Didn’t know what to expect but from the start found our tour guide Soham to be very friendly, the tour lasted 4.5 hours and encompassed  a faste of Calcutta life. What came across is that Soham has a genuine passion for guiding and enabling visitors to taste and glimpse Calcutta. Personally I find his talks and explanations struck a good balance between being too long or over detailed and giving us enough to understand the part of Calcutta we were in. Cannot recommend Soham enough, have one more day in Calcutta and already booked another tour with him before I head back home to explore Diwali.",

I was travelling solo and had a day in kolkata and wanted to experience the real Bengali way....Needless to day this tour checked off all my boxes!\nWe took a walk through the city starting early in the morning,  used all of the local transport, walked over the howrah bridge, ate delicious food and had a nice long chat over Chai!😊 Also, experienced the bustling flower market and heard stories of Durga and Kali in kumartuli!\nSoham was very polite, funny and a fantastic story teller! He also made sure to keep me informed about where we were going next and moved at a comfy pace...More importantly I felt very safe...which was important because I was travelling solo. At the end he recommended lots of things I could do with the rest of the day and even helped me plan all that I wanted to do!\nI can say that I'm going to take all these stories home and kolkat a made me fall in love with India a bit more today😊\nI recommend this 100 percent!",

The tour was very interesting and we learned a lot about how the city is organized. The traditional breakfast was a perfect ending. Our guide, Soham, sent us the photos he took during the walk and he is a good photographer. Thanks. I suspect that this tour was the highlight of our brief visit in kolkata!",

          "text": "My first visit to Kolkata proved to be a fabulous surprise and revelation. I connected with Soham in February after following his Calcutta Capsule Instagram account for 12 months and his correspondence and planning were Superb. These Included airport pickup to his Owls Nest Airbnb followed by his Magic Hour Tour and train to Varanasi. The accommodation was excellent with a lovely roof terrace with a plethora of bird life over looking the parks of the Old Town. The Magic Hour Tour included all modes of transport walking, ferries, auto rickshaw, buses, ambassador taxis which were great fun and Soham passionately provided an extremely comprehensive and professional historical, cultural & economic overview throughout the whole City. It far exceeded our expectations and I would highly recommend The Magic Hour Tour with Soham. Many thanks Soham & TC for a visit of a Life Time!",

          "text": "The Magic Hour Tour by Soham from Calcutta Capsules is my number one recommendation if you're visiting Kolkata and would like to experience it beyond the famous tourist sites. It's so thoughtfully curated to include all the lovely quirks of this city — taking you through the quiet, early-morning neighborhoods to visiting the delightfully busy flower market, and even taking a lovely walk on the Howrah bridge (among many, many other things!) I absolutely loved how we had a chance to travel using all the different public modes of transport and have a traditional Bengali breakfast at the end :) And throughout the tour, Soham was incredibly invested in helping us understand the city's history and culture, along with ensuring we had a hassle-free experience.\n\nCongratulations on putting together this lovely tour! :)   ",

We didn't regret it.  Prior to our arrival Sugar was very attentive and responded almost immediately to any questions we had.  We met our driver Sushil on the first day in Delhi and he accompanied us on our tour of Delhi and then took us to Agra and Jaipur.  Each day we had a local guide who took us to all the important sights, Sushil dropped us off at each point of interest and collected us when we were finished.  Our guides, Saurob in Delhi, Rahoul in Agra, Ali in Fatehpur Sikri, and BK in Jaipur were all excellent and had a great knowledge of all the sights we visited.  Sushil was great company on the drives and he educated us on local customs and traditions.  We had great fun with him.

We felt safe at all times. \nOur guides kept us informed of all we saw and they tailored our program to suit our interests. \nTravelling by car was a great way to experience \"Real India\" particularly when accompanied by Sushil who had many amusing and informative things to tell us!\nWe will definitely be recommending this company ( and Driver!) to friends that plan to travel to India in future.",

We did Delhi to Agra, Agra to Jaipur, and Jaipur to Delhi, with a guide in each city. I highly recommend opting for the tour guides as they are all professional and offer priceless insights.

Ankit (Sugar) listened to all my needs in booking a trip, suggested amazing insights to our itinerary, was prompt with his response, and at a fair price. My wife and I were visiting from the United States and looking for a private tour of the Golden Triangle. Our driver, Parveen, was always on time, a phenomenal driver, offered great insights, and went above and beyond to make our trip remarkable. We were in Jaipur for Diwali weekend, leaving right before the festivities, and he suggested and led with us a special Rick-shaw ride through the streets of Jaipur to admire the atmosphere of gorgeous lights. It was something we will never forget, and will always appreciate his willingness to show us something so special. Our tour guides in each city were also incredible. DIBC does a phenomenal job choosing the guides. All of them have many, many years of experience and insights. One of our favorites was in Jaipur, mr B.K., was so knowledgeable and shared personal stories and experiences into culture at each destination. Even taking us to amazing monuments and temples on the way that we hadn’t planned.\nI will be recommending Parveen and DBCI to all that want to travel to India. It is a top company and best experience possible! Thank you Parveen for all you did for us!",

We wanted to be collected from the airport, driven around for 10 days and eventually returned to the airport for our trip home. Sugar suggested an itinerary, which was pretty much exactly what we wanted to cover, but we weren’t under any pressure to follow it exactly and could add anywhere that we wanted to visit. I thought that the price was extremely good and no payment was required until the end of the trip, so there was no financial risk.\nWe arrived at Delhi airport to be met by Sushil, our driver for the next ten days. He was amazing …. bearing in mind he is not a guide (Sugar organised an official guide for certain places) he was very knowledgeable and his English is excellent. We chose the hotels we wanted to stay at and booked those online independently, some meals we ate at the hotels but, when requested, Sushil made some excellent suggestions and drove us there in the evening and collected us when we had finished. No Delhi Belly for the whole trip!\nAll in all Sushil made our visit to India unforgettable and I’d highly recommend this company. ",

My driver Mr Parveen was very kind and courteous throughout the tour. Nothing was too much and he was happy to offer suggestions on timings and places to see. Leaving Delhi, I asked if I could see some street art and this was no problem for Mr Praveen. He brought me down different streets and gave me lots of time to take pictures.  The car was spotlessly clean every day with charging ports in the back and wifi. I thoroughly enjoyed my trip from the beginning to the end. The tour guides were very knowledgeable especially in Agra and Jaipur. They were able to answer all questions asked and they knew the best spots for photographs. I have recommended Mr Parveen to my friend who wants to do the same tour next year. This was my first trip to India but it won’t be my last, it has completely surpassed my expectations. ",

We have toured the golden triangle and every step of the way have felt completely safe - locked doors, careful driving and real care for our safety. As two young females travelling India this was hugely important for us. Even outside of the car Sushil made sure we were in safe hands always. \nHe has educated us on all things India and been so patient with our endless questions! \nRight from the moment we arrived Sushil looked after our experience, nothing was too much trouble, at any time of the day. \nOur first experience of India is one that we will always remember with love laughter and friendship thanks to Sushil. \n\nMany thanks also to Mukesh, Ali and BK who were fantastic guides over our experience. They really showed us the true India and have such insight into the amazing landmarks ",

We checked our plans with him and he took us on the most logical route, he is a true gent - he drove so safely, checked on us when we got to our hotels, had fresh water and a clean air conditioned vehicle for us every day. The other guides provided by DIBC (Makesh, Ali and BK) were all fabulous and made our trip to a hectic country beyond amazing! Cannot thank Sushil and the guides enough, I would recommend this service to any friend or family member. Thank you so so so much!! We love India!!   ",

          "text": "We decided to use discover India by car based on trip advisor reviews, and we have not been disappointed. Our driver, Mr Parveen has 25 years experience of driving and we felt in safe hands. He was a calm, confident driver, very punctual, friendly and courteous. There was always chilled water available in the car and the car was kept spotlessly clean from day 1 to day 10. Mr Parveen's knowledge of the area was invaluable; he was able to suggest places to visit and recommend places to eat, which greatly added to our trip.\nWe used guides for several visits to the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri and the Amber Fort. The guides helped to negotiate the queues ( and sellers pushing their wares) and were very knowledgeable.  Discover India by car arranged the guides on request for us only the day before.\nHaving a driver meant that we were able to fit in so much more than we could have otherwise done using public transport, visit sites off the beaten track, and rest in a comfortable air conditioned car in between visits. I would highly recommend this service. They are also quick to respond to any queries.",

We started with chai then made two curries a Dahl, cumin rice and chapati. \n\nDimple also gave us her delicious biscuits, green chilli and Indian dessert. As well as extra chapati cooked with spices and poppadoms! Dimple leads the cooking and is the expert chef while Bunty explains more detail about the dishes. Dimple got us involved and helped show us skills like keeping the chapatis round. \n\nThis is an intimate and informative cooking class. You are in their home and it feels very welcoming and comfortable. It is great value for money. We went at 10am and left at 12. Don't eat  before!! You will be so full. \n\nDimple gave us extra cookies and jewellery as a leaving gift. \nBunty sends the recipes afterwards so you can recreate them at home. \n\nThey also have a homestay apartment. It's much cheaper than where we stayed. If you can book there to stay aswell! It has a cool rooftop and the apartment is huge!!\n",

          "text": "I highly recommend the Pink City Cooking Class with Dimple, Bhoomi and family, I had the most fantastic time. The whole family was so warm and welcoming, and I immediately felt like I was at home and part of the family.\n\nDimple was very knowledgeable and passionate about Indian cooking, and had a fantastic collection of fresh ingredients and spices that smelt incredible.\n\nShe guided me through a number of dishes with great expertise - we made masala chai, butter masala paneer, aubergine potato curry, chapati and poppadoms. \n\nWhat I appreciated most about the class was the emphasis on using authentic ingredients and traditional cooking techniques. The hands-on nature of the class allowed us to not only learn but also enjoy the process of cooking.\n\nThe highlight was when we tasted the dishes we had prepared. The flavors were simply outstanding, and I couldn't believe I had created such delicious food. The intricate flavors really transported me to the heart of India, and tasted far better than the food from restaurants.\n\nOverall, the Indian cooking class was a fantastic experience. I left with a deeper appreciation for Indian cuisine and the confidence to recreate these dishes at home. I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to explore the flavors of India in a fun and interactive way. I would definitely go back, and next time I am in Jaipur I would love to stay at their homestay as well.\n\nThank you all for such a wonderful experience!",

          "text": "Our tour guide Zozo was wonderful. So much information!!  This is a FULL day tour. You get a taste of each site. Zozo did a great job giving us as much time as possible to see everything.  There’s just not enough time available for Windsor and Bath. But well worth it to get a taste and see where you would want to return when have time to spend. Could easily spend whole day at Windsor and whole day (or 2) in Bath. Had a great time.  Our driver Christian was also great making sure we got everywhere on time. Thank you!! Merry Christmas ",

          "text": "Great tour. Eugene was a fantastic guide. He was very knowledgeable and gave great tips. We also encountered some unforeseen difficulties on the road due to road closures caused by an accident, and Eugene was exceptionally patient and helpful. Highly recommend. But note that you get very limited time at each location (that’s the nature of this kind of tour). Just barely enough to snap some pictures and do a quick walk through. If you would like to spend more time, I would recommend taking the train from London and doing day trips to Bath and Windsor, which are easily worth a whole day.",

This isn’t the tours fault though as they can’t control them opening the castle. Every time we were actually at the location it felt very rushed to actually be able to see it. I’d do it on my own so you don’t have to deal with other people being late and loading a bus full again. ",

And, they did it in such a way that I wasn't exhausted (and my wife, who usually gets tired before me...she didn't get tired at all!).   I'm not sure of the magic they used but our tour guide and driver were fantastic.   At every site, I thought I saw just enough and then it was on to see something new.  I'd recommend the Pub lunch too.  Food was good and then...some side tours of Harry Potter movie scenes and other areas of interest.  \n\nI would not hesitate to just order another Premium Tours.  In fact, I'm using that as one of my booking criteria.  I feel like I stumbled on to a good thing and I'm going to use them again when we're back.  ",

Unfortunately, we learned that morning that we would not be having lunch but having dinner provided instead.  The town of Lacock where we had dinner would be lovely to see, but it was pitch dark when we arrived. We also had thought we would have access to Bath, which we did not.  It is a great tour, but a very long day (13 hours).  You get just over an hour at each location for exploring before moving on, the guide does not go into the location with the group, but gets you there and explains beforehand.  Thankful we did the tour, but I would choose a much shorter one in the future.",

Windsor Castle and Bath were both beautiful. \n\nMy only recommendation is that during the winter, the pub lunch/dinner option isn’t necessary as it’s dark by the time you get to the town and it’s hard to see much. I would recommend going without that in order to get some more time at the other sites, but other than that it was a great time!",

We could have tried to drive to these locations on our own but it was invaluable getting all the history and valuable advice and information from our tour guide before we arrived at each destination. I was also very happy that although there were several accidents on the motorway, our expert driver was able to mostly keep us on schedule and safely get us where we needed to go even though I wondered how he would be able to fit such a large double decker bus through some of the village towns and roads.

We rode auto-rickshaws through Old Delhi neighborhoods, walked through Chandni Chowk, ate some jalebis, saw the Red Fort. Sujal took great to ensure the comfort of my family, who found the experience unforgettable. Sujal discussed various options with us to customize the tour to our satisfaction and based on his input, we decided to skip Qutub Minar and visit Akshardham temple instead - it was amazing! Sujal was very informative and courteous and prioritized the needs of our family when I told him our kids needed to eat lunch first before continuing the tour . Sujal took us to an excellent lunch spot before we rounded out the tour at Humayan's tomb. \nWe we were also very happy with the tour management who accommodated our last minute request to add 2 more local family members to the tour - they handled it quickly and got us a bigger & very comfortable vehicle. The driver Seva Ram was also very polite & accommodating when we had to take a slight detour to pick up the family members.\nOverall, an amazing, memorable experience that I would highly recommend!",

We were treated to a myriad of beautiful historical buildings, markets, and classy local stores including world class tea store and Kashmir textile store. Our experienced guide Arvind knew all of the historical stories behind the sites we visited, and ensured we felt safe at all times. Our driver Ajay was wonderful too and we honestly would give this trip experience 11/10 if we could. We stuffed up the location for pick up and due to our own mistake our driver and guide went to the wrong hotel. They were so patient and accomodating to us despite this. My female friend who I travelled with also loved having Arvind and Ajay, as she felt very safe in their company. Please do yourself a favour and book.",

I opted for the 5 star hotel stay and for me it was worth it. \n\nFirst and foremost, my driver Prithi who was with me for the 4 days was an absolute legend. Not only was he very professional, he was also very funny and went out of his way to make me comfortable and take me anywhere I wanted to go if time permitted. The car ride was very comfortable and the car itself was kept spotless with plenty of water aboard if you ever feel parched.\n\nMy guides Naveen (Delhi), Dharvinder (Jaipur) &\nArif (Agra) were very knowledgeable, passionate and professional in their work. Also don’t get fooled into getting a professional photographer especially at the Taj Mahal. All 3 guides are practically professional photographers themselves. They know all the instagram spots for a great photo. Giving me directions on how to pose to give me the best photos possible. Cannot recommend this tour enough so if you’re looking at this tour, do yourself a favour and book it in. Thanks once again to the whole team, you made my trip to India very memorable and one I won’t forget anytime soon. All the best :)",

Additionally, our guides took us to upcharged tourist souvenir shops that were clearly meant to take advantage of us.\n\nWe also learned that travel by car is quite tiresome. I'd recommend traveling by train (you can get first class tickets) and hiring a reputable tour guide.\n\nOur hotels were supposed to be 5 star but we were disappointed by the hotel in agra and jaipur. jaypee palace is clearly a tourist trap. the hilton in jaipur had a strong perfume masking the mildew smell which made our clothes smell for the rest of the trip",

It's very disheartening to see that you are penalizing us this way.\n\nStill we apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.\n\nWe hope to see you again in the future.\n\nBest regards,\nGolden Triangle Delhi Agra Jaipur Tour / Crystal India Holidays.",

We also really appreciated that he let us customize our day and go to a cafe we chose for lunch and that he didn’t pressure us to go to shops or anything like that. He also knew all the best photo spots and took excellent pictures of us at the Taj! The pickup in Delhi and train boarding were very straightforward. Thanks to our Agra driver Salman and our Delhi driver Arun as well for their service. The booking experience was also very professional and simple, which can be difficult to find in this area. Absolutely recommend this tour package for anyone visiting Agra for a day trip. ",

Raj was very knowledgeable, friendly, and took us to the most beautiful spots for photo ops. We especially liked the sand boarding experience and the dune crashing in his 4x4 vehicle. The camel ride was short but also a nice touch to the entire tour. Will definitely recommend the afternoon tour as it was beautiful seeing the sunset over the sandy hills and sea.",

Texted the guide beforehand, as the sea looked a bit rough, just to be sure it was still on. To be fair did get a response “which tour and which location”, which didn’t fill me with hope ! Replied and rang but no further messages. Turned up anyway and another tour guide rang as well. No response. Shame really all they need to do was text me and say they’ve cancelled. No worries we would have understood and stayed in the restaurant drinking wine. Went back and drank wine anyway and requested a refund which was given a couple of days later.

This type of activity is extremely dependent on the weather and on the conditions of the wind and waves which can change even suddenly. You made the reservation only a few hours before the departure of the excursion, and you were spotted by Viator message as usual, with immediate refund as per procedure. We have also offered you another date for the experience. We are sorry too and we understand your frustration, but trust in your understanding which is not out of our responsibility.

          "text": "Selamat was very helpful in organizing everything end to end. Sent me a message to let me know train to Agra in the morning was booked out and would arrange economy class seat instead. I told him I would prefer to go by car in that case and he arranged it. The car which came was nice and clean and the driver Rahul was very courteous. Upon arriving in Agra we met our guide Imran, who was very knowledgeable being a local from there for 3 generations. He took us around Taj Mahal, explained everything patiently, helped us take pictures at the right viewpoints. Was more than happy to answer any questions. We then had lunch which was good with starters served at the table then a buffet with a large variety of offerings. We picked up the local petha and dalmoth (locally famous sweets and snacks) from Gopal Das and Panchi stores, you can try before buying there. We were then taken to a marble emporium where they do inlay work just like how it’s done at Taj Mahal. Learning about the process and then browsing through the pieces available was eye-opening as it’s a dying craft globally. Pieces were really beautiful. Last stop was Agra Fort before Imran and Rahul dropped us to our train. Imran came right up till we were seated on the train and a pre-arranged driver picked us up from where we arrived in Delhi. Selamat was in touch the whole time to make sure everything was going fine. Would highly recommend this package. ",

It’s well worth it, given that there’s so much to see in Agra and it was great to have a designated car to get from each of the sites, as Agra can be quite busy. You can also skip the lines with a certified guide. The day I went, the train schedule was messed up so, they offered to have a safe and speedy driver (Muveen!) pick me up from Delhi and drive back in the evening. Altogether a great day!",

We met our guide Farid on the platform. The Taj is really spectacular but Farid’s explanations and commentaries are what makes this tour really worth it. Agra fort is also great and impressive. Because we were very late getting to Agra we ended up going for lunch late afternoon and we honestly found that the BBQ-buffet was average at best, with little options. Also, the tour was supposed to include a visit to baby Taj, which was never mentioned. It would not have made a difference because we probably would have skipped it. The train back being delayed at least 4 hours, we opted to return by car and also had to skip the visit to the stone workers shop in order to reach Delhi at a reasonable hour. Overall an amazing experience with some slight annoyance caused by the weather. ",

He took the time to explain to me the historical and cultural details along the way. He acted like a friend, not a tour guide. He met me at the railway station with flowers, nice and clean car for the tour, great buffet restaurant for lunch, a few gifts shops with no pressure to buy anything. And at the end of the tour, he made sure I sat at my seat on the train before he left. End to end, I was taken care of. Highly recommended tour and tour guide!\n",

We booked our visit for a weekday and we had a wonderful time (If you plan your trip on the weekend, be prepared for a lot of traffic in Agra). Our drivers were good and our guide, Ferid, was fantastic. He embodies a passion for his job and the hospitality India is known for. From his open heart to history and storytelling about the city of Agra and the Taj Mahal. We would absolutely book more tours & travels with him. The lunch was a decent flavor buffet style, they spoke and understood English, and were very considerate of my allergies and made separate food.",

IndianCircle assigned a tour guide and driver to me, and I couldn't have been happier :-). \n\nThey took me to do what I wanted to do (a street shave, tailor a blazer, eat local and visit work colleagues, too), showed me places and things they knew I would enjoy (Lotus, Vishnu and Jain temples and Old Delhi market), put me in a most comfortable 4*hotel (Nüo), and picked me up and dropped me virtually door to door at intl and domestic airports and train stations to/from the Northeast. \n\nI cannot recommend them enough. \n\nAs soon as they get an easy online credit card deposit and final payment system going (which admittedly, is tough for non-Indian credit cards), it will make things even easier and more comfortable for both parties, tourist and tour company. Am certain they will sort this out soon. \n\nEnjoy your visit to India with IndianCircle!",

          "text": "This review should be read in full since there are both pros and cons.  \nPros -\n1.  Viv was our tour guide and she was amazing!  So incredibly personable and knowledgeable of all things food, wine, and the area!\n2.  The food was absolutely incredible, I actually went back to one of the restaurants after the tour because I was craving the one dish so much but the service was terrible (but not for the tour).\n3.  The wine and scenery were also amazing!\nCons -\nLeft hungry - see\nWe knew another couple that eats about the same amount as we do and they left very full (different tour).  I am not sure why but we were not full at all.  I think this tour was arranged especially for us since the one we originally scheduled was cancelled.  \nFirst place we each got a glass of sparkling wine and a cheese board to split.  I am sure the cheeses were expensive and they were delicious - just not a lot of food.\nSecond place only one glass of wine was ordered and that was split between my husband and I.  We had the most incredible clam chowder that I ever had (that is what we went back for) and we each got a normal serving.\nThird place again - one serving of wine split between the two of us and one entre split between us and an order of flat bread split.\nForth and final - again split the port wine, split a dessert.\nWe figured out that that the company made $255 after food, wine and tip.  I understand it is a business - again - we thoroughly enjoyed it, just would have liked a little more food and wine.  \nOur tour guide was so incredibly sweet and gave us so much helpful advise...Hope this helps.  Forgot to take a picture of the cheese board.",

We are very clear in our marketing that everyone receives a half a glass of wine at each four stops. We buy the food like normal customers, pay tax and 20% tip. I can promise you we do not make $255, if only.  As a matter of fact, we loose money on two people tours, but I did not want to cancel since you had already been moved.  It seems like overall you had a good experience, and for that Viv and I are both happy!",

She was very knowledgeable about the history of our stops, as well as the food and the wine. She was very easy to talk with and wasn't in a hurry. It was a walking tour, so she pointed out various interesting tidbits along the way. The restaurants were well chosen and the food and wines were delicious. By the time our tour was finished, we all felt like we had made a new friend. We would highly recommend this tour and, especially, Viv! ",

Even though it was only my husband and I on the tour Renee honoured the tour rather than disappoint us snd cancel it. \nEverything was perfect , despite it being December the weather was glorious. We were able to sit in outside in beautiful locations, overlooking the scenic bay . The wine and food did not disappoint . Food included cheese platter , shrimp cocktail, chowder , ‘nudie ‘ ravioli with home made bread , chocolates and bread and butter pudding to finish ! Delicious . Wine ranged from pink fizz , to rose , to red . A lovely afternoon. Thank you ",

The food tastings were delicious as we visited four different restaurants, all within walking distance. No one felt \"rushed\" to move along to the next stop. The only reason I give it 4 stars was I assumed their would be more of the wine tastings. We only sampled three wines total, but that could have been my misunderstand of the tour. It rained most of the time, but Arlene even brought umbrellas for everyone that didn't already have one.",

Our first stop was at a lovely restaurant, The Girl and The Fig, where we enjoyed delicious cheese, fig compote and yummy Quiche Lorraine.  The food was paired with a JCB No. 69, 2016 Sparkling Brut Rosé and the girl & the fig, 2017 Rosé.  The second stop was at FIGONE OLIVE OIL CO. where we had the opportunity to take amazing olive oils and balsamic vinegars. This family owned business grows olives in the nearby San Joaquin Valley.  Our third stop was at The Delhi Belly Indian Bistro.  The extraordinary Indian creations were paired with Cline Viognier wine.  Our last stop was at a tasting room for a specialty, high-end wine company, Galatea Effect, where we enjoyed several wines from their Conoscenti collection.  Renee was a great host, was very knowledgeable about both the foods and wines that she arranged.  We loved the tour and would do it again.",

Our tour guide, Arlene had interesting stories to tell us about the restaurants, the area and the types of wines that were pared with the food.  Visited different types of venues and had very enjoyable food and wine selections.  Enjoyed that last stop for coffee and desert, which was a place we would have never found on our own.  Just enough walking between venues.  We would recommend this tour especially if you are new to Sausalito as we were.",

Was great to know how regulated the industry is for consumer safety. The desert was vast and formations very cool for photos. Would definitely recommend this day trip to see some other parts of the country. Great for all ages. We traveled with 2 adults and one preteen. ",

He was very kind and took us to all of the scheduled places and kindly took pictures of us. He was a good driver and the vehicle was sound and safe. We could not have visited all the sights we saw without a knowledgable driver. But it appeared that he hadn’t been fully trained as a guide per se. We asked a lot of questions, but there was little historical narrative or information shared without the questions we asked. Overall, we enjoyed our tour but would encourage his company to invest in training for the actual “guiding” element of the tour. ",

Our tour guide Zain was very knowledgeable and excellent and very accommodating as we requested to either shorten or lengthen the various stops throughout the day. Mostly we shortened the planned stops as we wanted to return to our ship by 4pm, but it is nice to know that they are willing to give you plenty of time as needed. We would highly recommend Zain.",

          "text": "This was a great tour, packed full of wonderful sights from the city to the desert! Our tour guide was Sajid Khan, who was informative, kind, and considerate. He was always glad to stop to allow us to take a photo whenever we wished. A fun highlight for this particular tour was seeing the fishing industry up north, and the amazing market that contained wonderful varieties of freshly caught fish. Sajid was flexible with regard to our itinerary. When we arrived in the morning, the Museum of Islamic Arts was closed so we saw other things first and went back to the museum later. We had a delightful walk along a mangrove trail, where we saw lots of little crabs scampering about. What a surprise to see this in the desert! The architecture of Doha is breathtaking, and Sajid knew the best spots to view each building. All in all, a lovely trip.",

The moment we got into his car, Ali felt like a family member and related to us as if we were his parents or aunt or uncle. Any and all questions we asked were answered with honesty, sincerity and details about his life and culture and history of the region. This man became the highlight of the excursion and we will never forget him. If you book this tour or others by Golden Adventures Qatar, ask for Ali.",

          "text": "We set off from Doha with our tour guide Khalid  from doha tourism  in a good air conditioned car. Our first stop was Al Khor, which is a fishing village. We were too late to see the fisherman with their catch but viewed the harbour. We headed to the World heritage Al Zubara fort and then Al Jumail archaeological site and then on to Al Shamal to experience local food in a local restaurant. The temperature was very hot (about 40 degrees) but we still enjoyed the experience. If you are interested in knowing more about Qatari history this is a good tour to get to know Khalid  was a wealth of information and a good ambassador for this company.",

We did the 4 hours and Anwar was so happy to accommodate anything we needed and very aware of the fact that we had young children and made the tour fun…. He even paid for my son to get candy floss as we didn’t have cash on us. So very grateful! \nWe booked at 11pm on 23rd and met Anwar at 11am on 24th Christmas Eve. \nSuch professionalism and easy to book and pay.\nWe have already recommended to friends coming to Qatar and will be returning as soon as possible.\nThanks team!",

Driver Radish was driving really safe, never got unsafe in any way and we could stop and buy food/bathroom whenever and however long we wanted. Got to see the most important sites in the golden triangle with knowledgable guides and also saw a tiger very close! Also since it was private guide and driver it was flexible. For example, one of us got a little sick (unrelated to the trip, chronic issues) and it was no problem to stay a little longer at the hotel and be picked up later while others could go on that days tour. Would definitely recommend anyone who want to see all the important sites without any hassle! ",

We really felt he looked after us.  Each guide of the city days we had great English speaking guides.  There is a lot of driving, lots!  If you can afford an extra day, stay extra in Jaipur.\nNo tigers- requested small jeep for morning safari.  Didn’t have high expectations, but saw interesting landscape and other animals",

The driver Chain Singh was amazing and got us safely to every destination. All of the tour guides in each of the cities were very knowledgeable, and happy to answer all questions. Only sad thing was that we didn’t get to see tigers in Ranthambhore but that’s because we did a morning safari versus an evening safari (apparently you are more likely to see them in the evening). We chose to stay at all five star hotels and they were all absolutely stunning. Clean, beautiful, well-kept, and great beds. The staff was very helpful. Breakfast included in the hotels was plentiful.",

          "text": "This tour was amazing! It’s a busy four days but well worth it. We went to pretty much every stop as promised, and everything we saw was exceptional. Ranthambore is stunning regardless of whether you see a tiger (we did!) and worth the drive. The hotels were great (especially the Jaypee Palace and The Tigress). It is a light itinerary in Delhi comprising mostly of places on the outskirts of town, so I’d suggest an extra day or two in Delhi which we planned for. Our driver Kamal was a fantastic driver with a very comfortable car- he was really an additional guide with so much information! Our guides in each city were quite good too. Can’t recommend this tour enough!",

The hotels were all high quality -- I particularly enjoyed the hotels in Agra and Ranthambore (wasn't as big a fan of the Radisson in Jaipur - too sterile and westernized, though perfectly clean and nice). Agra was incredible, and the highlight of the trip - the Taj Mahal is everything it's cracked up to be, and the Agra Fort was great as well. Jaipur was lovely also, especially the Jantar Mantar and Amber Fort / Mirror Palace. The safari in Ranthambore was a little disappointing, in that we saw no tigers and in fact no wildlife that I couldn't see at home in the U.S. It was also a long drive to get to Ranthambore and back. But it was still enjoyable and interesting, and the hotel there is great. Overall, Crystal Tours of India delivered what they promised, and it was a great way to do sightseeing in northern India.",

Be aware that the local guides show you also some demonstrations of local crafts. It really depends on you if you want to buy something from the stores. Nobody is pressuring you into something. The whole tour is really worth the money if you want a seamless tour without to worry about guides and transportation. ",

The places we visited were amazing, the Hotels were top quality. \n\nThe tour guides (Naresh, Maneesh and Mukesh) were polite, nice, knowledgeable and helpful. They would not only be tour guides but also take pictures, show best places/angles for photos, help us carrying stuff and provide advice. \n\nOur driver Bindar was excellent as well. He was nice, respectful, polite, helpful and gave us a peaceful, comfortable drive through the \"colorful\" traffic of India. Bindar would also accommodate to support small special requests outside the tour itinerary.\n\nWe didn't have face-to-face contact with the local tour operator (Amit), but he was very efficient in the previous coordination, communication, logistics, package preparation and instruction manual. He was also flexible in allowing us to make changes to the trip.\n\nWe are very happy with the tour. One advice to reduce your time in car would be to make separate flights arriving in Delhi but departing back from Jaipur (or vice versa).",

We toured New Dehli with a tourguide who was very informative. Then we drove to Agra to the Taj Mahal. Our guide Racheed was amazing with the camera, knowing the ins and outs of each location. We arrived at the Taj Mahal at 5 am just so we could get amazing photos with no people in the background. Then onto the Tiger Safari. The Tigress hotel was gorgeous! Although it rained and we did not see many animals the jeep ride in the rain was an adventure in itself! Still worth the extra day. Finally Jaipur was beautiful. Our guide was funny, alot of one liners and he knew alot and helped us navigate the cultural differences. Overall the trip was worth the expense and time.There is nothing I would change. Only recommendation, from a female point of view is to bring your own toilet paper. Not a commonly stocked item :)",

          "text": "An incredible 4 day trip around the Golden Triangle.\nThe cities were beautiful and the guides were fantastic along the way with brilliant knowledge, and spoke with very good English. The hotels were all super friendly and very comfortable, we were surprised just how amazing they all were. The highest praise goes to our driver Sharwan Kumar, who’s great humour, knowledge and tentativeness, made the long daily drives fly by. He would always turn up on time and would always ensure we were comfortable, topped up on water and ask if we needed any breaks. I was actually ill one of the days, and he took care of me and recommended a drink that would help, and sure enough I felt better by the evening.\nThis was a fantastic tour and I couldn’t fault a single part of it!",

Responded quickly to my messages and arranged for pickup at the hotel we were staying at (somewhat outside of downtown Delhi, as we were there for a wedding). Our driver, Sohan arrived early and was prompt and professional throughout the entire trip. Car was in excellent working order (especially A/C)! \n\nLicensed, local guides at each stop (Delhi, Agra, Ranthambore, and Jaipur) who were very knowledgeable and friendly. In particular, our guides in Agra (Manush) and Jaipur (Yogi) were outstanding (and took GREAT photographs)! Great dining recommendations by our guides and our driver.\n\nWe paid for the 5-star option on hotels. All three (Jaypee Palace in Agra, Tigress in Ranthambore, and Radisson in Jaipur) were outstanding. Staff at each went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Our server at the Tigress, Bhatti Lai was particularly memorable in the level of service he provided. \n\nIf we were to do it over again, I wouldn't have done it any other way. Visiting the Golden Triangle is a singular experience - this is the way to do it.\n\nSome cautions: drive times between cities are LONG (as in several hours); be ready. Also, we found that we needed quite a bit more cash then was recommended (though I'll admit that we tend to be generous tippers). I think we needed about INR30,000 in cash to cover admissions and tips for everyone (restaurants took Visa). We also discovered that we were limited to INR10,000 max on our withdrawals at ATMs (not sure if it was just our bank) so plan accordingly. ",

It was such a varied and fun tour that included multiple well thought out components. Our highlight was our wonderful guide, so engaging with our kids and sharing so many  interesting stories with us all. An unforgettable day - highly recommended!",

          "text": "I had a great time traveling through Delhi with our guide Shaily and our driver Surinder. I had a full day of sightseeing at the various stops included on the tour. Humaiyan's Tomb was probably my favorite stop on the tour - it was so large that it didn't feel crowded despite how many people were there. Some of the other stops were pretty dense with people, but they were all still enjoyable.\n\nDriving on the streets was a little scary at first with how congested they are, but our driver drove very well and kept us safe during the trip.\n\nAlso, if you go in the winter, you're likely to experience fairly thick smog during the day - definitely bring an N95 mask. It can make some of the landmarks a little hazy, but you can't really avoid it.\n\nOur guide was very knowledgeable, kind, and enjoyable to talk to. She was always nearby to help guide us through the sites (barring the one that doesn't allow private guides) and took a ton of great pictures for us along the way. She also kept us engaged in-between sites as we drove through traffic. Shaily and Surinder even went out of their ways to show us additional sites along the way, like a historic “haunted” well on our way to our lunch location, and a crowd of monkeys on the side of the road.\n\nHowever, the tour company requires a mandatory shopping stop at a predatory store called “Delhi Haat Craft Cottage Industries” meant to trick foreigners who want to go to Dilli Haat, a government-run handicraft market. We couldn’t leave until we were shown each one of the store’s 4 floors full of overpriced items galore. Some salesmen let us go when we made it clear that we weren’t going to buy anything, but the painting guy in particular kept us for a long time trying to get me to buy “only one piece.” According to Google reviews, the “pashmina” scarves and “hand-woven” rugs are also fake, and they send you a fake bank statement after requesting a refund. My recommendation is to drink the chai as quickly as possible, refuse all of the products, then get out to your last stop. I don’t hold our guide responsible for this as it seems to be a mandate passed down from management, and she didn’t make any false pretenses about the stop, she just informed us that we would be able to see some interesting products should we wish to buy them.\n\nOverall, I would still highly recommend this tour, but be prepared to resist the sell near the end.\n",

My husband and I could tell that Shruti loves her hometown as she was very knowledgeable of the city and areas that we visited. She made sure to point out special highlights not to be missed. Our driver Sultan was an amazing driver and we felt very safe in his car. At one point we had some car problems, and just like that a new car appeared. Did not miss a beat.  Again, thank you to Shruti and Sultan for a fabulous tour of Mumbai. We will never forget this excursion. Simply put, a glorious day!",

Communicating with the local operators has been a hassle and definitely not worth the money we paid. First the driver was supposed to pick us up at 7am but ended up showing up at 9am due to incorrect information given to him by his company. When we when reached the Taj Mahal I thought everything would be fine but I was very wrong. \n\t1.\tThe tour guide kept leaving us cutting through the lines which was very uncomfortable since people were waiting for a while. \n\t2.\tThe tour guide didn’t know that a member of our group spoke Hindi and said to a photographer who was trying to sell us his services “ They are playing hard to get and don’t want to buy anything”. That’s not very respectful to say. \n\t3.\tHe repeated the same information a thousand times and gave no substance to the tour. \n\t4.\tHe tried to make us pay for the rickshaw to and from the Taj Mahal when it was the company’s responsibility. \n\t5.\tThey couldn’t find the driver to take us back home. \nOverall, I’m very disappointed with this experience and hope that no one has to endure this kind of treatment.",

He was taking care of our needs and making sure he was there when we were out of every single site.\n\nOn another note, I recommend two things, first, try to be early because it gets super crowded and people don’t respect the queues :( we had a small incident because of that. Secondly, check how foggy it will be, it makes a huge difference.\n\nFurthermore, just consider if it is worth hiring any photographer from the place (I don’t think so) because they charge you per picture and I made that mistake.\n\nIn the end, our day was enjoyable thanks to our tour guide and driver but make sure you plan it properly.",

I loved that our guide would give us some context and history in the car before we visited each site and would always let us decide how long we wanted to stay at each. Our guide Naresh, I believe, also knew a lot about each location. We definitely had a fantastic day! Balwinder our driver is definitely one of the best and was very honest and friendly as he talked about life in Delhi. Highly recommend this tour! ",

We had an excellent driver and our guide was the best. He gave us options on what sites we wanted to see the most and routed us efficiently to maximize our time. He is very educated on the history of each site and we felt safe and appreciated the whole time. If we had more time I would hire him again and again.

But both of these were something we recommended and wanted to avoid crowd). ",

The trip is long and involves driving for most of the day so start as early as possible for good daylight. We skipped the abandoned village and Jubara fort but still got late for the mangrove. We started late from Doha and took long breaks because of kids which caused us to miss on daylight. Overall a very nice trip. Huzaifa our driver and guide explained things nicely along the way and mentioned interesting facts about the Qatari culture. I would recommend this trip specially in the winter months. ",

          "text": "We had a quick 4 day trip to Doha and were looking for a nice offbeat tour. Came across a full day tour to West and North Doha. The trip was absolutely fantastic. The pick up was on time in a 4x4 Land Cruiser and the best part of the trip was our guide Muhammad Ibtihaj. \nHis knowledge about the various places was superb, and did give substantial insights to the places we visited. We covered the main parts in a total of 8 hours, and visited the camel race tracks, fantastic art works, forts, purple islands, local markets for a quick bite and a lovely cup of Karak. \nFor anyone visiting Doha, this trip is a must and thanks to Muhammad for making the day so amazing.",

Then he showed us the Zubara Fort and the unusual mushroom-like soil formations, where we were able to take many impressive photos.

He skillfully drives while engaging in detailed explanations and chats with us. He also helps capture moments for our family during the journey, and encourages kids to climb some challenging spots. I believe a day of driving must be exhausting, but he still provided us with very satisfactory service. Thank you.\"",

          "text": "In early November, we visited Doha and opted for this itinerary. The weather was pleasantly cool, and the historical landmarks were truly astounding. We learned a lot during this trip. The itinerary stated a full-day tour of 6-8 hours. We departed from the hotel at 11 a.m. and concluded our journey at 6 p.m. for the return trip, estimating we'd return to the hotel right on time after eight hours.\n\nUnfortunately, sunset in Doha began as early as 4:30 p.m., so due to time constraints, we had to skip the camel track. Despite the guide's efforts to drive quickly, we arrived at the final attraction when it was already completely dark.\n\nDespite these disappointments, we're immensely grateful to our guide, Noor Raja, who was incredibly patient, friendly, and knowledgeable. He provided commentary on the scenery and history throughout the trip, provided food for the children, and even offered us tea to refresh. I would rate this itinerary four stars due to a few minor disappointments, but the guide deserves five stars.",

          "text": "We had an unforgetable tour with our great guide and driver Asim. We booked a Full Day Qatar's North and West Private Tour to be picked up at 8:00 a.m. in front of our amazing Najd Boutique hotel amidst Souk Waqif in the center of Doha. At 8:00 a.m. Asim waited for us in his very comfortable and well air-conditioned car and we could start our tour on time. Asim was a knowledgeable and competent guide who explained everything what was important to know about the sightseeing objects in a relatively compact form but he gave us also the time to relax when we wanted that. Asim spoke a very good English, was very helpful and was listening and responding on our wishes. We can Asim highly recommend to other customers, he is a wonderful person. We went into the direction of the west coast and our first stop was the camel race track, very interesting. Then we moved -in parts off-road - into the direction of Zekreet peninsula to the remarkable umbrella shaped rock and other exotic limestone formations, a favorite place for photography. We reached the remains of Zekreet Fort, a historical landmark there and the East/West-West/East art work by Richard Serra, four steel plates, each over fourteen meters in height. Situated on the north-western part of Qatar, we reached the Al-Zubarah Fort, the first UNESCO World Heritage site of Qatar and visited several other excavations nearby. Driving to the eastern coast line we asked Asim if it would be possible to see the Lusail football stadium in Katar's future city Lusail and the Katara Cultural Village at the edge of Doha. And it was really great that Asim modified the scheduled tour plan in an appropriate manner: We directly passed the nice city Al Khor and indeed he gave us the time to see (from outside) the football stadium surrounded by spctacular buildings and to do a 1-hour walk through the Cultural Village with the Opera House, the Amphitheater, the mosque and other interesting objects with finally, the beach area and a nice view on the skyline of Doha. He also changed the drop-off place from the hotel into the Villaggio mall, so that it was easy for us in the remaining time from 3:00 p.m. to have an own shopping experience, seeing another football stadium there and going back to the hotel via Metro (a technical innovation going driver-less) to visit still during day-light the phantastic National museum and the Museum for Islamic Art. Thank you Asim for this combined adventure tour.",

          "text": "My family and I had a blast in Barcelona. Our amazing tour guide Anna took us through Park Güell and La Sagrada Familia and explained everything in detail about Gaudi and the history of this beautiful Catalan city. She also made sure to be considerate for all group members and kept a comfortable pace. I would say bring walking shoes but our trooper of a guide did the whole trip in heel boots so it's intermediate walking. You have to see the art and architecture for yourself words and photos cannot fully encapsulate what has been created here. ",

          "text": "We had a fantastic experience with Barcelona Sailboats.  I booked based off the strength of their reviews and they did not disappoint.  They always answered my questions promptly using the online chat in English (and I'm very indecisive so I had a lot of questions) and the booking process was very straightforward.  It was easy to find the boat according to instructions.   We had to postpone the sailing due to bad weather and they offered to reschedule for the morning so we did that, and actually 830am ended up being amazing for a morning sail, the water is so calm and not a lot of tour boats out,etc,  so I would actually suggest considering the morning instead of a \"sunset sail\" all the time!  Our boat captain was David and he was very friendly and told us great information and stories.  I would definitely do this again when we come back to Barcelona and probably do a longer sail to a beach next time, it was so relaxing onboard.   It was really nice surprising my fiance with a private sailing experience like this, and the prices are very reasonable.  Thank you Barcelona Sailboats for a great memory!",

          "text": "We took our teenage kids on the tour of the Sachsenhousen Concentration Camp one of the days we were in Germany. George was our tour guide, he had great knowledge and passion about what we were about to experience. \nThe meet up location was easy to find, we had a few minutes to get some danishes for the road. There was a 45 min train ride to the camp/museum and it was a picturesque journey through towns and tree scapes.\nOn the short walk to the to the camp, George shared that the history (past and present)that the town shared with the camp. SS houses next to the camp are still lived in.\nAt the start of the camp and throughout the tour, George shared historical information that doesn’t always get emphasized. He did a great job giving reverence to the subject and being knowledgeable for questions asked. \nAlthough it was a 6 hour tour it went by really fast. I would highly recommend this tour, it was an incredible way to spend the day. I’m glad our kids got to see first hand the historical evidence of the individuals who had their lives altered through this camp. ",

          "text": "This was an excellent and very memorable day trip. I was nervous what it’d be like - especially as I was taking my 15 and 18 year old sons. I needn’t have worried. Insider Tours were fantastic. Our big group was divided into 3 groups of around 25 people each. All 3 guides were excellent and went off independently so we weren’t waiting on all the others. \n\nWe had a fantastic guide, Xavier, who was so knowledgable, kind, sensitive, wise and handled the whole trip and all the information superbly. He taught us all a great deal of interesting and useful things when we asked him questions on the train journeys - eg about relevant history and about Germany and Berlin today. My sons are not easy to impress, and thought they knew loads already from studying WW2 at school. But they were super-interested and engaged and focused throughout the whole day. \n\nXavier (and the other guides who were on a similar timescale, I’m guessing) kept things moving at a good pace so we learnt and saw loads, but didn’t get too overwhelmed by the trip at any point. \n\nI’d thought about going just ourselves with no guide in case we got stuck on a long tour that we couldn’t leave. However, I see now that that would have been by far the worse option. I am so, so glad we saw Sachsenhausen on a good tour like Insider Tours. The momentum stayed good and we got so much more out of it with a quality guide. Also it is a big, complex place to see, with lots to learn, and I’d much rather have a skilled guide than need to listen to audio guides throughout and face the trip feeling alone with it all. Also it's a profoundly moving experience and I was glad we had the support of being with a kind and sympathetic guide. ",

          "text": "This is such an important experience. If you’re debating going to a concentration camp or not when visiting Berlin, you should. The history is difficult but cannot be avoided, especially given the times we currently live in. The museum is organized to tell the experience and history of the space, without it being traumatizing. Our group was concerned about what we may encounter in the tour, but there were ultimately no anxiety-inducing moments. \n\nOur guide, Hannah, was incredibly knowledgeable and intentional about how she handled the tour. Her personal touch made it even more effective. She is welcoming without judgment, and even ended the tour with her recommendations for Berlin. \n\nA few tips for the experience. It is largely outdoors, so plan accordingly for the weather. Also, eat a filling breakfast and bring a snack you can carry on you and water. Chocolate is a nice treat to have on the ride home. There are no meal options once you leave Berlin. You will experience the full walk that prisoners were put through, so prepare to be walking. ",

          "text": "Fantastic tour. There was a big group of people when we met at the starting point. Insider Tours had 3 guides available and we split into 3 groups of around 25. All guides seemed lovely. We had Xavier who was absolutely fantastic. He was very interesting and knowledgable - on the journey there he was funny and engaging and told us loads about German history before and after the war - answering all the questions from people in our group.\n\n Our group was pretty young. I’d been nervous about taking my 2 teenage sons - 15 & 18. I needn’t have worried. He kept them engaged and focused. \n\nWhen we got to the camp, Xavier gave brilliant information in a sensitive, thoughtful way. He took us around the whole camp at a really good pace so that we learnt loads but didn’t get too overwhelmed or lost momentum. I have lost family members in concentration camps and I felt Xavier was profoundly respectful and thoughtful in what he said. He didn’t know my family history when we were on the tour. \n\nThe tour says 3 hours but that is the time spent in the camp. We left Berlin at 10am and returned around 4.15pm, with the train trip included. \n\nWe took water and snacks, and ate our snacks after we left the camp. \n\nThere are displays and small museum-type areas in parts of the camp. I’d wondered about just going ourselves, but I’m really glad we went with a quality guide. I think we got loads more out of the day and were able to see and understand a lot more in the time we had. 3 hours was a good amount of time to see and learn a lot but not get beyond the point that we could not take it in anymore.

He not only could answer questions about the memorial site, but also about WWII in general. It was clear he was well-studied. I also appreciate Mat’s flexibility and critical thinking. There was a train issue and he found another way to get us back using busses and the underground. I imagine that is not at all easy with a group of 23.",

The Castle is beautiful from inside . Each group of visitors is assinged a guide who explains the rooms and items in the room. There are tours in English. Tip is take a bus ticket one way to go upto Miren Birdge , buy one way ticket and from there trek to Castle, on the way back, trek down , it take around 30 minutes, if you go back to Miren bridge then trek more tough and will take more time.

Neuschwanstein was naturally at the top of my list for this trip, and this tour did not disappoint. \n\nCharlie was my guide, and he was fantastic. Usually there are two guides per tour; but Charlie had to handle all of us on our own as the other was sick. Charlie is a great docent, for all the usual reasons: he's knowledgeable, friendly, etc. But he shines in two specific areas: taking the subject matter seriously and caring deeply about his guests. The level of care displayed was phenomenal, and it truly felt like Charlie already somehow knew each of us. And in terms of his style, he avoids the usual corny jokes one usually hears on tours. He doesn't treat the subject matter as boring, using jokes to fill in where insecurity reigns. Instead, he treats the subject matter with respect, and encourages the group to do the same. It was really cool!\n\nAlso traveling solo? Here's an easy tip: board the bus first ;-)\n",

He had great knowledge of the castle, surrounding areas, and of course Ludwig. I found Ludwig’s life very interesting! \nOnce we got there we were able to have an hour and a half to look around before we headed to the castle with our guide. We liked this as it allowed us to get food and have a look in some shops. The castle wasn’t too bad to walk up, and I was so glad that a coach took us and picked us up. I love a good coach.",

There was SO much waiting around in the cold. We had an hour for lunch and to explore the village, but then 1.5 hours to walk/ bus/ carriage up to the castle which takes at most 40 mins if you walk. Then there was another 1.5 hours to get back down to the meeting point (again, max 40 minutes). It’s cold up there in winter and there’s no shelter from the rain so they seriously need to adjust their timings. \n- The cost: you pay extra for the castle, extra for lunch, extra for the carriage or bus ride. I’m still not sure where the €60 goes. \n- We booked expecting a max of 25 people in our group so were disappointed when we ended up with 52. \n\nCastle: 5/5\nCharlie: 4/5 \nOverall tour: 2/5 \n\nIf you can get up there yourself, it’s a much better choice than taking a tour.

Let me try and address some of your points. \n\nI believe it was a somewhat rainy day when you traveled and Charlie will have talked a little more than usual on the bus to avoid the group being unnecessarily stood out in the rain listening to him talk more. This will have likely also been communicated to the group. On less rainy days the information could be more evenly distributed throughout the day and perhaps not come across as too much. \n\nThe timings are set the way they are to allow enough time for people to make their way up to the castle whichever way they choose by either bus, carriage or walking, even on busier days with potential queues for transport. There are a number of view points to be enjoyed during this time also and most guests are happy to have the extra time to soak in the beautiful surroundings.\n\nSome of the 1.5h you mentioned to walk down could have been spent exploring more of the inside of the castle. Our guides usually explain this is more free time after the guided castle tour and can be used as people wish. The walk down is only around 30mins so people are typically advised to either spend more time in the castle or walk down earlier to grab food in the village. \n\nThe optional castle entry ticket is clearly advertised as an additional cost as are the bus and carriage ride up the the castle. Lunch is not advertised as included in the tour, though time is allocated for those who wish to purchase something. \nThe tour was supposed to have been led by two guides who would have split the group into two groups of 26 (total 52) One of our guides we found out was ill on the day so rather than cancel the tour for 26 people the tour ran with one guide. this was a last minute decision we felt resulted in more overall customer satisfaction. Given the multiple 5star reviews from other guests joining the tour that day that seems to have been the case. \n\nWe also agree those who are less interested in learning from our guides and who don't mind pre booking tickets well in advance and figuring out the logistics of getting there and up to the castle on time are probably better off doing it themselves. For those who prefer turning up and having everything taken care of who also enjoy learning from our guides a guided tour provides just those benefits. \n\nRegards\nRadius Tours",

Our tour guide, Charlie, took two tours since the other guide was ill and he managed 48 people like a pro.  His narrative of the castle and King Ludwig's life kept us spellbound and really wanting for more information.  He kept us informed of the day's events, made suggestions to enhance our experience, and intervened for people with special needs.  The castle is spectacular, and the area is charming. but the guide makes any tour - he is a jewel for this company, and I appreciate my first experience with Radius to be so memorable.",

Our guides, Charlie and Michelle, were absolutely brilliant and made sure we didn’t get bored on the journey there with lots of fantastic background information that helped us to really appreciate the castle when we got there. \n\nBe aware that the bus up the hill doesn’t run in the winter, so it is a substantial hike! Wear sensible shoes and bring plenty of water - it isn’t the easiest trek! There is a horse and carriage which can take you most of the way up the hill but I saw it didn’t run the full way, so definitely one to consider if you have mobility issues - you will need to trek uphill a bit! Michelle was brilliant at taking us up the hill in stages and at each pause giving us more information on Ludvig II which helped to keep the walk interesting. \n\nThe castle itself was stunning - get ready for some fantastic photo opportunities and to see some truly beautiful architecture inside. \n\nWould highly recommend going with Radius Tours if you’re thinking of visiting! Just do be aware of the substantial walk!",

Michelle is very knowledgable about the minute details of the era, and Charlie has a sense of humor and accents that we will be talking about for a while! :)\n\nThe tour is very well paced and the day trip flew by. There was time to eat and options to be active by walking up the hill to the castle or relax in a horse-drawn carriage to get to the castle from the town.\n\nI've been on tours in over 30 countries and this is easily in my Top 3.

The actual tour of the castle is really short, so they made sure to give us the history of the castle as well as the context of the stories depicted inside as we traveled there. It made the entire trip much more interesting and worth going. We had Tom as our guide and he was great! He was very friendly and knowledgeable about the castle.

          "text": "This was a fantastic tour. We decided to splurge and do the tour with everything included (tickets , snacks and drinks) and we are so pleased that we did. Having a smaller group and a comfortable coach made the journey worthwhile. Monika was very informative and interesting with her commentary and each of the stops were well timed, we walked up the hill and back down at the end of the tour of the castle, but be aware that it is a long walk up a steep road, so if you would prefer to catch the shuttle bus or horse and cart to save your legs, it will be a long wait and at an extra cost. Also arrive at the stop early if you wish to be seated together. The tour states to arrive at least 20min early. We were 35 min early and the bus was almost full! We also left earlier than scheduled since the group were all accounted for and ready. So pleased that we did this tour. It was an unforgettable experience that was well run. Thank you to our driver and Monika for a fabulous day! ",

The tour took us to Linderhof Palace, a short stop in Oberammergau; a cute little town and then on to Neuschwanstein Castle where we had plenty of time to get lunch and then to explore the town and castle grounds. The bus was very comfortable and offered coffee, water and a variety of snacks during the drive there and back which was nice.  Our driver was great and our guide Monika was very attentive and knowledgeable on the sites we visited and kept us entertained with her stories about German history and culture. I would definitely recommend this tour while visiting Munich.",

As could have spent another 45 minutes to an hour down in the little town or even get to visit the other castle there.

She was better than the tour guides in the castles and I wish she could have given us those tours!\n\nThe description does say the tour is physical AND IT IS! The way to the Sleeping Beauty castle is a long uphill walk if you don't don't have the time or want to wait for the horse carriage.\n\nThis tour is a bit pricier than some other similar tours but it was definitely worth it! The tour includes all the entries you'd normally have to pay separately for and Ursula made sure to escort us to where we needed to go.\n\nThey list \"premium\" in the title and they mean it! They had coffee, fruit, and snacks to start the day and a nice cold beer to end the day! The bus was cozy and lots of leg room with only 28 tourists on board, unlike the other buses we saw with around 100 people!",

From the pickup place, registration, buses well marked, summary of activities, time to rest stops, drop off at Berlin with tour guide, route taken for sightseeing, free time, and finally, drive us back was done very professionally. Matt, our tour guide, was a walking encyclopedia. Matt surprised us with his iPad full of pictures depicting his narration of every place. He was very friendly and helpful; made jokes and kept us very interested in the history. Jourgan, our driver, was excellent too. We fell safe while driving. No hard breaks; always smooth.

While it would not be practical to print a pamphlet for every single site we visit due to the extensive number of sites covered, we strive to ensure that our guides offer comprehensive and insightful information throughout the tour.\n\nIt's concerning to hear that you felt rushed and not adequately informed during your tour. It is of course impossible to provide a completely in-depth experience of Berlin in 5-6 hours, and the goal of our tour is to make the most of the time you have available on your one day in the city. However, your feedback is invaluable, and we will address this with our team to ensure improvements are made.\n\nWe hhope that we can have another opportunity in the future to provide you with the stellar experience that many have come to associate with our tours.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nSebastian\nVexperio",

          "text": "2 part review…\n\nFirst, the logistics were absolutely horrendous and their process needs to be changed. About 2 hours into the bus ride, we stopped at a rest stop/McDonalds. As we were walking out of the rest stop towards the bus, the bus pulled away and left without us. No one answered the “emergency” number provided by the tour operator. We were fortunate that another bus pulled up shortly after and we arranged to go with that tour group to Berlin instead. While on our second bus, a women mentioned that she wasn’t even part of this tour, but got on the bus thinking the bus would take her to the train  station where she had another tour waiting. There were no names being checked off when starting the tour and apparently no headcount being taken being taken at stops. Be warned!!\n\nNow for the actual tour - Johnny our guide was outstanding! He turned the day around for us. He was tremendously knowledgeable, funny, and made the experience worthwhile. We never felt rushed and had adequate time to see what was on the itinerary. The history and stories told about Berlin and its people were incredible.",

            "text": "Dear Paul,\n\nThank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent tour experience.\n\nOur operator was occupied with another call when your call came through. However, we did receive and promptly respond to the message you sent us, immediately contacting the other bus driver to ensure you were picked up. We realize that this must have been a situation that caused some anxiety, however we feel it is worth mentioning that we resolved the issue within a matter of minutes and ensured that you arrived in Berlin safe and sound and were able to join a great tour.\n\nRegarding the passenger check-in process, we do in fact have passenger lists and check-ins. It is worth noting that the day of your tour was one of the busiest ones of the season, during which we organized 9 buses and over 300 passengers. Furthermore, the ship was 30 minutes delayed in docking, which meant that when it finally docked, thousands of passengers spilled out quickly. Despite this, our port assistants managed to efficiently organize over 300 passengers onto 9 buses within 15 minutes - not an easy feat, and one only possible precisely because of our organization. This rapid action enabled us to give everyone who booked with us to get o Berlin with enough time to give everyone a great tour even with the delay from the ship. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that in such a high-pressure situation, some oversight can occur, and we deeply regret that you experienced the consequences of this.\n\nOn a positive note, we are thrilled to hear that Johnny, your guide, made a significant impact on your tour experience. Johnny is indeed one of our most knowledgeable and engaging guides in Berlin. We appreciate your kind words about his expertise, humor, and ability to create a memorable experience. We will pass along your compliments to Johnny, as recognition of his outstanding work.\n\nOnce again, we apologize for the inconveniences you faced during the logistics process, and we truly appreciate your understanding of the challenges we encountered that day. We value your feedback, as it helps us identify areas for improvement. We hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future and provide you with an exceptional tour experience from start to finish.\n\nIf you have any further concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our customer service team. Thank you for choosing our tour service.",

I was short on time in my travels through India, and decided to book this as it covered what I wanted to see. The driver was terrific navigating through the busy streets, and all tour guides in each city were very knowledgeable on all the sites visited as well as the city they were in and were also very personable.

He organised everything from the travel aspect, tour guides, and hotel accommodation. His responses were prompt and welcoming. Our personal driver, Mr Singh, was also prompt and helpful - utterly grateful for his services. All three guides in all three cities were knowledgeable, kind, friendly and helpful. They knew the ins and outs of each city well and knew which areas were requiring to be more cautious in.

It was truly not good. But the hotel in Agra was a dream. My driver was amazing and so kind. My guide in Delhi was out of this world amazing and my guide at the Taj & Agra was really knowledgeable, my guide in Jaipur SUCKED. and the places we visited in Jaipur were lame I couldn’t understand my guide and he couldn’t understand me.

          "text": "This tour was the perfect introduction to north India. We were met from our flight by Annu our driver and spent the day seeing the sights and sounds of Delhi with a tour guide. Annu stayed with the car and dropped us at places and picked us up after. We then moved on to Agra for an overnight stay in a fabulous hotel. A different guide on day 2 was excellent and knew where to take all the best photos! Then it was on to Jaipur, which is just beautiful. Again, a new tour guide but all 3 were excellent. \nAnnu is an excellent driver and his car was always spotless. He was great company on the longer parts of the drive too. \nReally recommend this tour, although my only regret is that we didn’t stay for 2 nights in Jaipur. There was just so much to see and so little time!",

There were so many logistics involved with our visit (I’m sure many of them we never even knew about), and they were handled flawlessly. Our driver was incredible, and we had three excellent and knowledgeable guides each day. The hotels were excellent as well. Looking back, it would have been impossible for us to coordinate a trip like this on our own, especially as first-time visitors to India.

The driver assigned to my trip (Dharmender) was friendly and courteous and drove safely and carefully on busy, chaotic roads. All the tour guides had good knowledge of the historic monuments I visited and I learnt a lot from them.  I felt protected and safe in their presence. The lunch eating places suggested by Viator were adequate and the 5 star hotels I opted for were of high standards with buffet dinner and breakfast included. The visits to factory shops offered an insight to the skills of the local artisans and an array of products to purchase.

First time in India, all arrangements worked smoothly: good car (excellent condition, plenty of legroom and headroom); excellent driver (careful, respectful, helpful); two excellent 5-star hotels, in Agra and Jaipur; three good guides (one really excellent). To be honest I don't know how the company/agency does it: to organise everything yet, given the expenses, still make a worthwhile profit. Anyway, trying to arrange similar would have required a lot of work, cost far more. Highly recommended, wouldn't hesitate for one moment to book with them (Crystal India Holidays) again.",

The tour operator was easy to communicate with via Whatsapp, our driver Jeet took great care of us from start to finish, and each of the three guides shared a wealth of knowledge and we saw beautiful sites.  The hotels they booked also were  first rate and included dinner and breakfast. Definitely recommend.",

The car was very good. \n\nThe tour guides were very good too and the experience of seeing the Taj Mahal at sunrise was amazing. The hotels were very nice, the only drawback was the dinner service at JayPee which was extremely poor. Other than that the hotels were very nice. \n\nAmit was the coordinator who let me know of details of the tour and was always on hand when I contacted him. \n\nI would 100% recommend this tour.",

Our tour guides were all incredible, in New Delhi we had Jyotsna, who was so lovely and knowledgable about the city. In Agra our guide was Mahipal, he took the best pictures of us whilst touring the Taj Mahal and all the other places we visited, and knew so much about the history of the places we visited. Our guide for Jaipur was Kunawat, who was great company, very funny and fascinated us with his astrology knowledge. Our driver for the tour was Kuldeep, who is the nicest man! We felt so safe and comfortable with him for our journeys. Very grateful for our driver and the guides who made the experience even better - thank you all very much 😃 ",

I opted for the 5 star hotel selection, and the quality of the hotels were certainly up to my expectations. The logistics of the tour were also handled very well, including the check-ins, check-outs, pickups, dropoffs, etc. My tour guide starting in Delhi (sorry forgot your name!) was extremely knowledgeable about the history of the area & it was very interesting listening to the detailed descriptions of our visited locations. Thanks also to guide Kumawat who managed to fit in many destinations in our tour of Jaipur on my limited schedule, and to driver Raj for getting me to each destination safely & efficiently to make the most of our short time! Would definitely recommend this tour to others, its very convenient if you have a few days in Delhi!",

You just sit back in your air-conditioned car and everything is planned to perfection for you.\nEverything about this tour was top notch. We stayed in 5 star hotels which were very good and I am missing the delicious food!\nThe best thing however was the people. Our driver Ravinder handled that crazy traffic effortlessly. His car was spotlessly clean and he was always at the entrance to pick us up with the aircon blasting 😀 It was very hot and humid during our stay so we really appreciated that.\nOur three guides were also all amazing! In Delhi it was Nitin, a uni student with a passion and great knowledge of history. For Agra our guide was Rashid. He is an amazing photographer! He took my phone and took the most amazing photos of the Taj Mahal and other Agra sights. Finally, in Jaipur we had Manoj who was also so knowledgeable. \nAll our guides spoke English well and were passionate about their cities and country. They made this tour so good!",

          "text": "Yesterday was just about perfect.  Our guide, Melanie, was there waiting for us under the canopy.  At the stroke of 3PM we headed into the Rathskeller for the first food stop – which was an individual plate with small samples of several German favorites, pretzel & mustard, 2 meats, cooked red cabbage, plus spätzle.  Then a leisurely walk through Lockerbie Square, where the guide had arranged an abbreviated (first floor only) visit to the James Whitcomb Riley house – really fun to see the original 1800’s kitchen.  \n\nThen a brief walk to the Lockerbie Pub for a scaled-down version of their famous Hoosier tenderloin with all the trimmings (including breaded, deep-fried pickle discs) plus flights of 3 different craft beers or wine samples.  An extra surprise was that Mayor Joe Hogsett had finished his lunch there and said hello to us on his way out.\n\nNext stop was Rooster’s Kitchen on Mass Ave. – near the Bottle Works construction - never heard of this spot.  Our reserved table was ready and the 8 of use were treated to a smaller version of their popular brisket sandwich on buttered & toasted sourdough bread, with a side dish of “charred carrots” – small strips of carrots brushed in olive oil and seared on the grill.  \n\nBy now we were stuffed but enjoyed a final stop on Mass Ave. at The Best Chocolate in Town for various chocolate treats or choice of ice cream flavors.   \n\nThree of the seven were from Chicago, four of us from Indy.  We all got along well especially after the flights of beer.  Melanie is a local nurse and does this as a second job – and her many stories about the area were interesting.  By the time we were done almost 3 hours had passed – with a fun group and great weather.  Could not have been better!",

          "text": "We found out about Pure Dive Resort via Google on Sunday and wanted to book a two dives trip on the Thursday thereafter. Their communication is fast via WhatsApp and they are very professional. We managed to book the trip, even though it wasn't 30+ days in advance (perhaps because it's low season). \n\nAfter filling out the necessary paperwork, we had a short briefing about the spot where we were going to dive. In terms of gear: everything is taken care of by them. You only have to wear your swim suit and bring a good mood. Our dive guide Abdul was very calm, relaxed, professional and had an eye for everyone's personal needs. I felt very safe with him throughout the whole dive. He knows the diving spots very well. Next time when we are at Nusa Penida, we are going to book more dives with Pure Dive Resort for sure!",

For those who do not bring a camera, the team sent us photos and videos after the dives too. We love the drift, abundant marine lives and of course the legendary mantas and mola mola!\n\nThank you team Pure for taking good care of us. Salute to Denys who is a great teacher and picks up sea trash during the dives. Special thanks to Sandra- who went out of her way and fixed my mom’s glasses! We can’t be more grateful! \n\nHighly recommend team Pure and we will for sure return. :)",

          "text": "We dove with Pure Dive Resort during the end of our trip to Bali at the beginning of June.  We got the stay and dive package so we stayed for 3 days at the Sameton Hotel and dove for 2 days with Pure Dive.  The staff communicated with us very well and we were able to make sure we had exactly what we wanted for our stay and dive.  From arranging our ferries to our transport to the hotel, everything was excellent.\n\nWe were happy to find a great dive center that accommodated all levels of divers.  The dive masters were friendly and helpful, so were the crew of the boat.   We felt very safe the whole time and were able to fully enjoy our diving experience.  The gear was well maintained and everything went smoothy, from the dive plan briefing, all the way to the review of the dives at lunch time.\n\nWe did 2 dives per day and had an amazing time.  We went to Manta Point and were lucky enough to see several huge Manta.  We also did dives at Suana, Toyapakeh Wall, and SD Point.  The coral life around Nusa Penida was amazing.   We could have done more dives per day, but we know how exhausting that can be so we just stuck with 2.   \n\nThe accommodations at the Sameton hotel were conveniently located just down the street from Pure Dive.   We had a lot of good food from the local warungs, and there were some beach clubs there too if you like that sort of thing.\n\nThere was one incident where another diver accidentally took my mask instead of their own when we returned to shore.   I communicated with the owner and she and the staff tried to locate my missing mask even so far as contacting all of the other guests.  Unfortunately it could not be found.  But she offered to pay for my missing mask which was very kind and professional.\n\nWe would definitely dive again with Pure Dive Resort.   They made our final days in Bali very memorable and it felt like we were staying with family.  So please visit with Pure Dive Resort, where tomorrow is always Manta Trip.",

I was the most inexperienced diver on board so I just dived with Victoria and she was really patient with me and gave amazing advice when I made a few mistakes as it’s been a while since I did my OW. Seeing the giant manta rays flying around was such an unreal sight I will never forget and still feels like a dream I had!

The first dive was with the manta, we saw two which was very cool, really enjoyed it! We had some tea, cookies, and fruit between the dives, which was nice! The second dive was closer to the dive school but still a very pretty dive site, with coral, some turtles and a lot of fishes. Overall it was a really nice experiences! They took some videos and pictures which turned out really good! Thanks for the amazing dives!",

We dived in small groups and safety was clearly very important to them.\nI would highly and happily recommend Pure Dive to anyone that wants to be well looked after and have an amazing time. \nThanks heaps to Ark and his team 😊",

They really made our trip to the island, and I would highly recommend them to any single diver or dive buddy pair wanting to dive off Nusa Penida. \n\nThey were terrific and highly knowledgeable. Intan was our dive guide and she was fantastic, able to point stuff out and her plastic moustache on her equipment made her easy to spot in busier areas. \n\nI first followed Pure Dive on Instagram and they exceeded my expectations.\n\nWe saw Mantas, turtles, different eels and lots of other colourful fish. I was very sad to leave.",

          "text": "Starting at pickup winding through the villages of Bali seeing all the locals walking to the water purification temple. Getting to the Luwak coffee plantation and then onto top the mountain. All an adventure in itself, then to continue onto the downhill cycle. We chose our bike and helmet and checked everything over. The guide then explained the gears and brakes, and a few pointers to us before starting. It was so amazing, the fields of mandarin’s, chilies, and marigolds. We meandered through it all asking questions and shouting back to the others so they heard also. We saw a family compound, a temple, a school, the president’s grounds, and so much more. The tour guide had fantastic English and was able to answer all the common and obscure questions on culture, history, and politics, posed to him by all of us on the tour. We truly learned and discovered so much from the experience that, I now have such a huge appreciation of Bali and its people. Followed by an amazing lunch from the kitchen staff and cold drinks. I felt well thought of and catered for, even having a refreshing towel after the 30km was unexpected and very appreciated. This is a tour for any fitness level as its all downhill, through the back roads and villages of beautiful Bali. Highly recommend for anyone wanting a genuine day out in Bali to experience a huge variety of the elements of Balinese lifestyle.",

It's especially heartening that your 14-year-old enjoyed the narrow off-road sections. Your compliments on the quality of our bikes, D's hospitality, and the tasty lunch at the end mean a lot to us. We truly appreciate your support for our local startup and look forward to welcoming you back for another fantastic time!\n\nBest regards,\nDika",

Safety was paramount, his clear instructions made it easy to understand and the route was the right amount of fun, challenge and local interest! Bikes and helmets are very good quality and he wanted to make our tour the best experience he could. Our 14 yr old son loved the off road sections and provided challenge for him! Route is carefully planned using quiet back streets passing local villages and temples. Lunch was equally impressive-tasty fresh food! We loved everything about the tour and highly recommend GOAT cycle tour and the owner, Dika! Thank you for the best day! I’d love to do this again!",

Anyone, fit or otherwise, can do it, and the tour takes you through the real non-touristy Bali, including villages, schools, houses, temples, and farms. You get to see local life closely.\nThe bikes are safe and in great condition. You always feel safe.\nGuides -Dika was amazing. Not only they supported all riders through difficult patches, they were highly informative, cheerful, and accommodating to all requests. They had paid attention to small things that came as a nice and welcome surprise, especially the clean, scented, cool, wet towel presented at the end of the tour to clean our face and freshen up....\nI would highly recommend to everyone.",

It wasn’t too overwhelmingly fast but not boringly slow, each new building we passed he gave us a brief yet interesting background, from the daily Balinese life to how different tea and coffee is made. Any mistakes were fixed with ease and patience since he only takes smaller groups for more attention. Overall, he provided great interest and fun to everyone and his English was great with no communication issues occurring. Thank you for this trip Dika :)",

          "text": "Food Variety\n\nAt Anggrek Putih cooking class in Lombok, each participant prepares one dish, meaning the larger your group, the greater the variety to try. Participants in our group could choose their cooking station (and thereby which dish they wanted to prepare) on a first come first served basis. We had 10 people in our group and were able to prepare/taste: Beef Stew (Beef Rendang), Chicken Satay (Sate Ayam), Corn Fritters (Perkedel Jagung), Fried Noodles (Mie Goreng), Fried Rice (Nasi Goreng), Grilled Fish in Banana Leaf (Pepes Ikan), Vegetables in Peanut Sauce (Gado Gado), Chicken Soup (Soto Ayam), Sweet and Sour Shrimp (Udang Asam Manis) and Fried Eggplant (Terung Goreng).\n\nFood Quality\n\nThe food quality is outstanding. Many of the ingredients come straight from the on-site organic garden. Before the cooking class starts, participants are given a tour of the garden and can taste veggies fresh off the plants.\n\nInstructions\n\nOur group had two instructors, one for every 5 participants, who would first show us (individually) what to do and then we would do it ourselves. Now and then, they would check on our progress and provide tips. Recipes are shared after the class (as PDF documents) – so there is no need to take any notes.\n\nVenue\n\nTiled and impeccably clean, the large covered open-air kitchen is set in a lush garden (together with other buildings, including a guesthouse and pool). Overhead fans provide a pleasant breeze in the hot afternoon. The L-shaped table layout with individual cooking stations for each person was a great set-up as it allowed me to observe and interact with other participants. There is a spacious dining table where all participants gather to enjoy the delicious dishes they prepare. Last but not least, a clean unisex toilet in easy reach from the kitchen completes the facilities.\n\nStaff\n\nAnggrek Putih is a family-run affair. Chris, the Greek owner who has lived in Indonesia since 2005, led our tour around the garden and made sure our glasses were always filled. His Indonesian wife, Dewi, and another Indonesian lady provided the instructions during our class (and I’m sure did a lot of other things behind the scenes). All speak English well and are very personable. Even though the cooking class has been provided for years, the team genuinely cares, and the experience felt very personal. Nothing transactional about it (unlike some other activities in Indonesia).\n\nSustainability\n\nAt Anggrek Putih, sustainability is a priority. Ingredients are sourced primarily from the on-site organic garden. No food is wasted: cut-offs are composted and participants receive any leftovers to take “home”. To further improve, we recommend Anggrek Putih consider wrapping leftovers in banana leaves (where appropriate) or using other bio-degradable packaging instead of (single-use) plastic containers.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Anggrek Putih cooking class and garden tour in Lombok is a great, fun afternoon activity – whether you’re a single traveller, a couple or a family (and whatever cooking experience you have). Chris and his team have perfected their cooking class experience over the years, and there is not much the team can improve upon. Our only (other) suggestion would be to keep the photo session shorter: After the welcome drink, garden tour and welcome snack, we were just keen to get started cooking.",

Chris, a tulajdonos az egyik legzseniálisabb idegenvezető/turizmusban dolgozó ember, akivel valaha találkoztam. Rugalmas volt, segített leszervezni az oda- és továbbjutásomat, az ára mindennek annyi volt, amit megbeszéltünk. Időben ott volt értem, és tettünk még 1 kis kerülőt, hogy több élményt gyűjtsünk. Az első perctől kezdve tudja mindenki nevét és készségesen bemutat a többieknek is pár szóban. A háza, kertje, ahol a tanfolyam van, gyönyörű, tiszta!\nChris pedig egy igazi mókamester, nagyon jó hangulatot teremtett. A felesége és segítői pedig végig segítettek nekünk a főzésben, a végén pedig kaptunk meglepetés desszertet. Este problémám adódott a szállásommal, Chris este 11-ig levelezett velem, hogy segíteni tudjon.\nEzen felül sznorkel túrakat is szerveznek, érdemes rákérdezni. \nHa Lombokon jársz, ne hagyd ki! :) \n*******\nI went on the cooking class, and it was one of the best experiences in Indonesia so far.\nChris, the owner is really helpful, he organized my trip there and towards. He knows everyones name from the first moment and he can make connections with everyone. He made a lot of jokes and fun and made it easy for us to get relaxed. \nCooking was fun, his wife and staff was around to help us when needed. Dining with many more nationalities is a great experience. His garden and house is unique, clean and beatiful! At night, I had an issue with my accomodation and he was awake with me until late night, tried to help me at his best. \nHe also has snorkeling and other tours, if you are around Lombok, make an appointment with him! :) ",

From the start, Chris takes you on a tour of his garden, showing us all the various vegetables and fruits on offer while doing a bit of sampling along the way, getting you ready for the main show.\nIt was very insightful and gave us a better understanding of what was going into the food we would be making.\n\nThen we put our aprons on, and we were off to work; it was a lot of fun interacting with the group, working together, getting to know each other and sharing great stories and memories from all over the world. \n\nOnce the hard work was completed, we moved on to the dinner itself, and OMG, it was out of this world! The explosion of flavours was immense, there was such an array of colours on the table, and the smells were to die for.\n\nThis experience was more than just cooking; it was a chance to switch off, forget about travelling and enjoy good food and company!!\n\n10/10 for me and my family x",

We started off with a tour of the garden…..phenomenal - all the fruits, vegetables and herbs that were growing.  Chris gave us a tour of the garden and provided lots of information about the produce growing as well as being able to taste some things along the way!  \n\nWe then went inside to cook.  Each person in the group was given the responsibility for one dish each.  The team were amazing.  We were quite a big group and they had many dishes to oversee and they did an amazing job overseeing, instructing and helping.\n\nThe food created was so delicious and there was so much.  We took food away with us and ate for lunch the following day.  The food tasted just as good the day after.  It was so delicious.\n\nThe recipes for all the dishes created is emailed after the class, so we will definitely be cooking the recipes at home.\n\nA really fun, engaging cooking class, highly recommend if you go to Lombok.  You will have an unforgettable experience.",

Dewi is a brilliant chef and her knowledge of ingredients and recipes is fantastic - their Indonesian/Mediterranean garden is also beautiful.\n\nBoth her and her husband Chris are also incredibly kind and generous. Not only did they keep us topped up with drinks and snacks throughout, but they also arranged for a personalised cake to be brought out at the end to celebrate one of our birthdays.\n\nCouldn’t recommend this more to anyone staying in Lombok (we were in Kuta and they picked us up). Cooking can quickly become stressful and hectic but they effortlessly made it fun and easy for everyone.\n\nWe also made some scrummy food!",

We choose Anggrek Putih due to solid reviews on Tripadvisor, Lonely Planet and Google Search. \nThis is not just cooking class, it’s farm tour about history of plants, how it had been discovered, Indonesia ingredients from 18th century cause of war. \nThis is cooking class designed and left us inspired. We learnt about the cultural significance and give us deep appreciation of indonesian cuisine. \nIt’s must to try to everyone who looking and discover a flavors and traditions of Indonesia.\nAnggrek Putih is a culinary paradise. \nFamily of 5, pick up on time from Katamaran.  Our driver Toto in a way for cooking class gave us tips where to go, where to eat around Senggigi.\nAnggrek Putih Cooking Class because they produce all ingredients in a huge vegetable garden, they have ability to provide you with best price.\nBeside the farm tour, include soft drinks, beer and wine, also free recipe books. \nThank you very much Chris, Dewi and Daphne.",

What was positive: quick access to the Vatican museums and the St Peter basilica. Also the tour guide was super friendly, clear in communication and navigated smartly through the crowds. However, I had expected a more in depth tour, with more in depth historical information. Also, I had hoped to be able to also see other parts of the Vatican museums that were not covered by the tour, by staying thereafter, but if you choose to do that, you cannot get the skip the line access to St Peters anymore. I think it is a good tour if you want a quick overview. ",

He was very knowledgeable and made sure we covered all the main paintings, sculptures, tapestries and history.  This was my second time to go on this tour (we took more family members with us for this trip).   I was very pleased with Christian’s knowledge, thoroughness, and presentation.  He did much better than the last company we used.  I would definitely book with this group the next time we return for a tour.  As always book with a tour guide and skip the long lines.  We were going through security check point 15 minutes after checking in with our tour guide.  I did not have the extra 2-3 hours of time to wait in the general admission line.",

It wasn't the perfect beach to learn at but we were ok with that to keep things close. The only thing that would've helped would've been to have one more instructor out there with them. We had 11 kids and 2 instructors, they did they're best to keep the kids going but there was a bit of waiting around to get pushed into waves. All in all, a good day and experience for the kids!",

We're so glad to hear that our office team accommodated your custom request. We're also pumped to hear that our instructors were so professional and helpful. \n\nAs we mentioned over the phone, where we hosted your surf lesson was not the beach location we recommended but a beach that you requested we host your lesson at despite us recommending against it. \n\nWith the accommodation of the custom beach location on a busy Saturday in July we were only able to offer 2 instructors. We also typically assign 1 instructor per 5 surfers and when the 11th surfer was added the day prior we were already sold out on instructors for that day.\n\nI hope this helps bring clarity to why your lesson felt more like a 4 star experience instead of a 5 star experience. \n\nLastly, thank you so much for your kind words and for booking a surf lesson with us. We are so stoked that it was a good day for the family during your stay at the Ritz Carlton.",

Visiting the Pakistan Monument, Saidpur village, Daman-e-Koh, Golra Shareef, and Shah Allah Ditta Caves were quite an adventure. Islamabad has so much to offer with its rich history and beautiful landmarks. It was great that Maqsood was nice and informative, making my experience even better. I  ❤️ Islamabad!",

          "text": "Ronaldo and L from Galicia, Spain\n   We had a beautiful day in July ina Islamabad with our guide Maqsood and his driver that took us around the city.\n   This small tour, about eight hours, around the beautiful town of Islamabad is a really good introduction to the capital of Pakistan and gives you a good welcoming picture of the city and the life there. It's a balanced tour between the country up in the mountains and the city.\n   What surprised us was that Islamabad is so green, trees in all streets, and parks everywhere and it makes it really an oasis in a dry world. From Daman-e-Koh we could see the whole city and the dominant colour is of course the green. The mosque Faisal is also placed in a beautiful setting surrounded by the mountains.\n   So it was a memorable day, of course we asked our guide Maqsood to put his favourite pakistan music while travelling in the car, and so we had the opportunity to enjoy among others the fantastic Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan  singing the unforgettable Aankh Uthi Mohabbat Ne Angrai Li.",

I was a bit nervous about how we would meet up, but Ghulam contacted me well in advance and I immediately liked him based on our messages.  Even though our flight came in late the night before our tour (1:15 am), Ghulam offered to pick us up at the airport and drive us to our hotel.  During that ride, we got to know him, and became excited about our first day in Islamabad.  We saw so many things, we learned so much about Pakistan and Islamabad, and we felt so welcomed by Ghulam.  He made the day easy, and he helped us take so many wonderful photos.  I can’t say enough good things, but I would say that if you just have one day in Islamabad, and want to see the highlights with a local that will make you feel like a friend, then sign up for this tour!",

Once I arrived in Islamabad, he was waiting for me and had a nice comfortable car ready for us to explore Islamabad. Thankfully, there was even wifi in the car. We had a short time becaus eof ny late flight arrival, but he managed to take me to so many places. Also, his picture taking skills were awesome. However, the highlight of the day was that he invited me into his home to have dinner with his family. This was truely unforgettable.  They were so sweet and delightful. The food they served was incredible. Since my flight was leaving late at night, he didnt want to leave me at the airport alone so his family entertained me until well after 10 pm. I couldnt ask for more from a tour. It was like visiting an old friend.",

Ghulam is amongst the best guides we have had in all of the countries around the world that we have visited over the past 25 years or so. Ghulam is very knowledgeable and personable and he managed to include a lot of sights to our day without us feeling too rushed. It was also great that we were able to customise the tour to our interests, and Ghulam even arranged a couple of great surprises for us during the day, most notably a chance to meet Sayed Gul Kalash, an archaeologist who works to preserve endangered Kalash culture (thank you Sayed for your warm hospitality and a change to hear directly from you about you and your work). I feel we learnt a lot about Pakistan and its rich tapestry of history and culture from Ghulam. Although the day was long, the time was certainly well spent. We would choose Ghulam as our guide should we ever visit Pakistan again which says a lot about how much we enjoyed the tour.",

Easily reachable via WhatsApp before and after the tour, flexible scheduling, historical context, friendly and inviting attitude, air conditioned car (a true blessing in this summer heat). Not only were we able to book 3 days out with no issues, we were able to change plans as the day went on (pushed back lunch, dropped my friend back off at the hotel early because he was too exhausted to spend the whole day out). He also has years of experience in tour  guiding aka picture taking so we had amazing photos to go along with our great memories. We even added in a little souvenir shopping and knowing the upcharge I get for being a tourist it was extremely helpful to have him as our guide and negotiator. \n\nHighly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Islamabad.",

          "text": "Jan is an incredibly knowledgeable and charismatic tour guide, with a clear passion for Vienna's eclectic history which he's able to make so contagious through vibrant story telling and interesting, often hilarious, facts, that we were actually interrupted mid tour by a documentary team asking if they could record his speech about one of the monuments he was explaining. Being very professional, he initially declined to break from his tour but I insisted he give a brief interview so that viewers of the documentary could enjoy his engaging speaking style and expertise too. His tour was really nuanced and tailored to the individual, offering an array of recommendations on where best to eat in the city and hidden gems, from the special backstreet cafe that serves coffee in cones through a window, to funny 'treasure hunts' for certain secrets of St Stephen's cathedral. He even provided a break in the tour to sample some culinary delights at one of the locals' preferred haunts for strudel and cake. The most special part of the tour for my family was the fact that we visited Vienna to celebrate the birthday of my late father, who was always intrigued by the history of the city; with this in mind, Jan kindly included facts he thought my dad would have liked to know after learning about him, and even made a beautiful suggestion of sponsoring a rose in memory of him at the Volkesgarten, a possibility I would never have known about without Jan's insight. I hope to visit again sometime and feel like I've left Vienna with a much deeper appreciation for the city, and with a new friend too. ",

The team is very keen on safety so it felt all very good to go up the mountain with them and fly up to 500 meters above the ground. \n\nWe ‘booked’ online and all info was given via whatsapp. The way Daniel communicates is great and makes you enthousiastic even before you are up in the air. \n\nIf you go to Lienz, you have to get a flight for sure.

Dieser Flug mit Daniel war nicht nur ein unvergessliches Erlebnis, sondern auch eine einzigartige Chance, die Natur aus einer neuen Perspektive zu erleben.

I've taken wine tours with Frisco Limo two times now and their tour guides are always such a joy! In September, this most recent time, Ted was such a wonderful host and planner. My friends were in town and we hadn't really planned where we wanted to go, so Ted just asked about our wine tastes and price points and took us around! We had a blast in the party bus and we had lunch at the Oxbow market where everyone was able to get something to eat that they were excited about. Thanks again Frisco Limo, hope you're doing well in these hard times. We're definitely coming back.",

If you’re looking for a private experience and going to small local wineries that are off the beaten path then call Jeremy. He was so thoughtful and considered our preferences and helped to make a perfect experience. Not only did he plan a day for us where they drove us around but was very helpful with other recommendations for when we were on our own. We will be back and already planning another trip and definitely going to use them again. ",

We would not have had this experience anywhere else to be sure. The Mercedes sprinter he picked us up in was very clean and comfortable. He also supplied us with endless waters which was vital on a day long adventure of wine tasting. Jeremy was not just our driver but also a tour guide and historian for each vineyard. He had incredible wine tasting tips and we were very appreciative of how seamless the transfer to each winery was. \n\nHighlights were: Unique wineries not open to the public, customer service, the wine!\n\nOnly thing we would change next time is budgeting for a little more wine as we were in love with all the wines but many were above $80/ bottle which begins to add up!

From the airport transportation to/from San Francisco to a scenic tour of the coast including the redwoods and horseback riding on the beach in Bodega Bay.  Everything was perfect.  We even threw in a day of brewery hopping in Santa Rosa for me to balance out all the wine tasting and food.

We started the day taking photos of the Golden Gate bridge but not from where all the other tourist do it from the other side of the bridge in a private area that no one seem to know about. \n\nNext off to the Simoncini Winery where we enjoyed a private tour and five course lunch with wine pairings.   Did you hear me say private? We were the only five guests at this very exclusive winery.\n\n I’ve been to both Napa and Sonoma, however I’ve never experienced anything as fabulous like this before. \n\nWe completed our day in the Armstrong redwood park relaxing on the trails and taking in the amazing views.\n\nJeremy is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly! \n\n And also did I mention that this was a bucket list trip for my 84-year-old mother? She was over the moon!\n\nJeremy-  Can’t wait till we can come back and plan another trip. Thank you so much!",

          "text": "We did a tour of the Braastad distillery in Jarnac France. It was an hour and half with a personal guide called Eric. This is a family run distillery and the processes from grape to table are all done here. So you get to see how the grapes are distilled stored and bottled all in the one place and people are involved in working at each part of the process. The distillery is amazing and the cask storage is worth seeing. There is even cognac stored since 1845. They have bottles going back since the distillery first started. The history is so interesting and the process fascinating.  Our guide Eric was brilliant so informative and friendly he was happy to answer all our questions and made the place come alive for us. The tasting g at the end is great. You get to try the cognac and compare the different flavours. I would highly recommend this tour as an enjoyable interesting experience well with the time for a visit on your holiday. ",

On arrival we were greeted by a very professional and friendly ground staff, from the get go we felt like we were in very safe hands.  Once on board the helicopter, put on the headsets to a very friendly pilot and we instantly knew we were in safe hands, the flight was circa 26 minutes and covered everything you would want to see in NYC which an excellent commentary and history lesson.  Both landing and take off were very smooth and has restored my confidence in flying again.

          "text": "We really enjoyed our husky experience. The transfer pick was on time and comfortable.  The suits and boots provided were super warm and excellent - it was very organised change room that was warm with helpful staff getting everyone correctly fitted out.  The staff were friendly and clearly loved and cared for the dogs.\n\nWe were told how to correctly approach and pat the huskies and sit on the sled.  \n\nThe husky ride to the tipi was fun - you are sitting almost snow level and going past the most incredible winter wonderland.  We went on morning tour, and in early Jan we had beautiful colours in the sky as we rode through.  A short fika break with lovely chat in the tipi and warm drinks and cinnamon buns before heading off on the return trip. We were able to visit and pat the husky puppies when we got back which was lovely.  There was plenty of opportunities for photos and husky pats.\n\nThe only downside to our experience was due to our height.  We are both tall, my husband is 6' 5\". As the tallest, he was seated at the back of the sled to correctly balance it, with me in front and another 2 people in front of us.  As we had to ensure our feet were correctly on the sled (so as not to hit toes etc as you travel along), we really had to sit quite uncomfortably on the sled.  My feet had to be on top of his because I couldn't put them further forward due to a metal bar.  The positioning meant our knees and legs were quite uncomfortable and despite very much enjoying the experience, we were very keen to get ourselves off the sled.  I think if you are tall, it would be better to have more space on the sled if possible.  Not sure if a more private sled for 2 people would have resulted in a more comfortable ride.  However, I want to emphasise that we are both very glad to have experienced the husky ride and enjoyed the experience, huskies, staff, fika etc and would recommend Husky Tours Lapland.  The trails are quiet and peaceful with no one else around.  ",

When we got there, they borrowed us proper winter clothes which was very important as it was a -30 degree C day. They allowed, encouraged and explained how to play with the dogs and that was really cool. The landscapes on the tour are beautiful and the sled is very safe! The Fika at the stop on the way was very pleasant, I felt like I was in ancient times. I regretted not taking my ski goggles because it was an extremely cold day. I would encourage using voice command to record images because taking off the glove is not a good idea. I highly recommend this tour.",

After the ride, I saw the staff padding each dog like \"you did a good job\" They don't push the dogs to run faster. If anyone wants the fast ride, go for Nascar race experience. We are not supposed to force the creatures for our own entertainment. No doubt why these dogs are super friendly. Happy dogs are from how the owner takes care of them.

We didn't catch the name of our guide, an australian guy, but he was super nice and open when we had questions. The tour felt longer than what it actually was which made you appreciate it even more and you could sit back, relax and look at the nature. \n\nAgain, ++ points for the very happy and friendly guide!!",

After the trip we had also the chance to be with the dogs and help to give them food and see how they do after every trip but at the same time it felt like the transfer was waiting for us and we really didn´t have the time to hang around a bit more has we would like to.",

I feel it was sufficiently long to enjoy wilderness and not put too much pressure on our bodies and on the dogs. It was -25 C when we went but thanks to the extra overall provided we did not feel the cold. If you want to stay with the dogs more during the break you can do that but a few minutes in the tent help with the low temperatures. \n\nAbout the dogs: they are amazing. If you approach them from the front and they smell you, they accept cuddles and some of them even ask for more. They are so cute and so well trained. We got to ride with some younger dogs too and you could tell they were doing their best to learn from the adults :) \n\nAbout the place: picture tells all, paradise. We got to see wild moose as well.\n\nAbout the team: all super nice and eager to share information about the dogs, about the place, point wildlife. Definitely must do activity!",

It became the highlight of our entire vacation. We still feel the same excitement and energy while mentioning it to everyone we know! \n\nThe hosts were super nice, the travel guide who  drove us to the kennel, the person responsible for the clothes etc. and of course our tour guide.  The most happiest part was to see the lovely dogs, all so eager to just run into the wilderness. The moment we stopped in between for a warm tea and tasty cinnamon buns, the dogs got so restless as they just wanted to continue run. \n\nWe also compliment the entire team involved for taking such a super nice care of the dogs and loving them like a family!  \n\nSpecial shout out to the owner: you have  made such lovely trails that we just couldn't stop appreciating it throughout the tour and even after that :)  It shows the hardwork and the passion you put for the work :)",

Loved the places we stopped and all the pics we were able to take, especially the 911 Memorial. Gil made the tour interesting! He was very attentive to all the guests, and made sure everyone was having a good time. We were so impressed with him that we invited him to do a Broadway show with us; though he declined, he knew something about every show in town.

She was great about making sure we stayed on schedule so we made the ferry and didn't miss our chance to see anything or that the tour ran long. Her love and enthusiasm for NYC shone through the entire tour.\n\nArliss navigated through traffic and around obstacles and street closures without a hitch. The president was helo-ing into NYC that day and we ran into some closures around the Statton Island Ferry and other locations, but Dana and Arliss clearly knew they way around because, with only a minor adjustment to the schedule, the tour continued uninterrupted. Anytime we left the bus, Arliss was right there to pick us up afterwards. Both Dana and Arliss  were friendly and charming. We had a blast.\n\nI highly recommend the small van tour since with 12 people you get a much more interactive experience and it is easier to hear and speak with the guide.",

When I left the minibus and took selfie with the guide I saw all the other 9x ‘tourists’ had left the minibus. \nI have lost my $200 backpack and $500 rayban - thank god not my passport. After such a great tour disappointing that staff trust seems to be an issue with the company. Otherwise would have been 5star. Enjoy the rayban guys!",

Four of us on a sledge, pulled by ten exuberant and very friendly Alaskan Huskies, under the command of Gaynor, our expert driver and guide.  \nTo experience a form of transport centuries old, gliding through frozen forest is quite something…Half through the trip we had a welcome break for coffee and apple cake round a fire … then the second half across a frozen river and lake. \nWhat was most obvious is the affection between the drivers and their dogs, the enjoyment the guides have in ‘doing their job’ and the care this small company take over their customers. As part of the price, they provide hi spec jackets, ski pants, mittens and boots and today, given the wind chill at -20, these were very welcome.\nLastly, thanks to Natalie, who drove us to and from the trail - a sledge driver too in her own right. A young woman from Bavaria, she ‘ came to Kiruna for a year, and this is my sixth !’ Obviously she loves her job, as you will love this trip.",

Natalie is very passionate about her job and she made sure everyone is well taken care of. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed the trip thoroughly. Got to see the beautiful winter scenery as we took the sled over frozen lake, led by the very friendly and hardworking huskies. We also had coffee and pastry in a tent with camp fire.\n\nWas initially apprehensive about taking dog sled rides but it turns out that the guides are bigger animal lovers than me. They made sure the dogs are well-fed, well-rested and enjoy what they are doing.",

Seats were very narrow and stacked on top of each other. Worse than an airline. However, we were given frequent stops that made it bearable. Our tour guide was awesome",

          "text": "Really disappointed. We were delayed on multiple occasions meaning less time at Scenic World, we were only able to ride the skyway before having to depart. The weather was awfully cloudy and foggy so wasn’t even able to view any of the scenery and did not see the Three sisters, which is highly disappointing. More annoying is the fact we did not have time to reach the forest floor via the railway simply because there wasn’t enough time available. So disappointing, especially after travelling such a far distance. FJ tours were specifically unhelpful. Other participants were worried we would miss the ferry back to our location, so we were unable to view scenic heights like echo point. Ultimately a very upsetting trip 😕",
